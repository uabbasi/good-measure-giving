# Accessible Research Writer

Write white papers and guides that make complex topics accessible to general audiences while maintaining scholarly rigor.

**The challenge**: 8th grade readability + deep insight + verifiable citations. Like The Atlantic or good Vox explainers—never dumbed down, always clear.

---

## Core Constraints

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| **Reading level** | 8th grade (Flesch-Kincaid ~60-70) |
| **Length** | 2-5 pages (800-2000 words) |
| **Citations** | Every assertion backed with link |
| **Scholarship** | Best-in-class sources (not just Islamic) |
| **Format** | PDF-ready white papers |
| **Competition** | TikTok attention spans—earn every sentence |

## Writing Principles

### 1. Simple Words, Complex Ideas

**Don't dumb down the idea. Simplify the language.**

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "facilitate" | "help" |
| "methodology" | "method" |
| "implementation" | "how it works" |
| "subsequently" | "then" |
| "approximately" | "about" |

**But keep the substance:**
- Complex concepts explained through analogy
- Technical terms introduced once, then plain language
- Nuance preserved, jargon eliminated

### 2. Short Sentences Win

- Average sentence: 15 words or fewer
- Mix lengths for rhythm (short punchy + medium explanation)
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice default

**Example:**
> ❌ "The implementation of zakat distribution methodologies has historically been predicated upon scholarly interpretations that vary significantly across different madhabs."
>
> ✅ "How should zakat be distributed? Scholars have disagreed for centuries. Different schools of Islamic law give different answers."

### 3. Front-Load Everything

Readers skim. Put the point first.

**Paragraph structure:**
1. Main point (first sentence)
2. Evidence/support
3. So-what/implication

**Section structure:**
1. Key takeaway (bold or callout)
2. Explanation
3. Source

### 4. Every Claim Gets a Link

No assertion without a source. Format:

> "About 3.5 million American Muslims give zakat each year ([Pew Research, 2024](https://example.com/source))."

**Source hierarchy:**
1. Academic research (peer-reviewed journals)
2. Major think tanks (Pew, Brookings, ISPU)
3. Government data (IRS, Census)
4. Quality journalism (NYT, WSJ, The Atlantic)
5. Primary religious texts (with scholarly translation)
6. Reputable Islamic institutions (AMJA, Yaqeen, SeekersGuidance)

**Avoid:**
- Wikipedia (fine for background research, not citation)
- Unsourced claims
- "Studies show..." without the study
- Dead links (verify before publishing)

### 5. Compete for Attention

**First 50 words must hook.** Options:
- Surprising fact with source
- Counterintuitive claim
- Direct question that reader wants answered
- Brief story that illustrates the stakes

**Throughout:**
- Subheadings every 150-200 words
- Pull quotes for key insights
- Bullet lists for scannable info
- White space is your friend

## Structure Template: 2-5 Page White Paper

```markdown
# [Clear, Specific Title]
## [Subtitle that previews the insight]

**[50-word hook: surprising fact, question, or story]**

---

## The Big Picture
[150 words: Context. Why this matters. What's at stake.]

## What We Know
[300-400 words: Key findings with citations.
Use subheadings to break up.]

### [Finding 1]
[Evidence + source link]

### [Finding 2]
[Evidence + source link]

## What This Means
[200 words: Implications. So what?]

## What You Can Do
[150 words: Practical application. Clear next steps.]

---

## Sources
[Full citations with links for all sources used]

## Readability Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] **Flesch-Kincaid grade level ≤ 8** (use hemingwayapp.com)
- [ ] **Average sentence length < 15 words**
- [ ] **No paragraph > 4 sentences**
- [ ] **Every assertion has a citation link**
- [ ] **First 50 words hook the reader**
- [ ] **Subheadings every 150-200 words**
- [ ] **All links tested and working**

---

## Citation Format

### In-Text (preferred for flow)
> Research shows that 85% of American Muslims consider zakat obligatory ([ISPU Muslim Poll, 2023](https://ispu.org/poll)).

### Footnote Style (for dense sections)
> The eight categories of zakat recipients come from a single Quranic verse.¹
>
> ¹ Quran 9:60. Translation: [Sahih International](https://quran.com/9/60)

### Source Block (end of document)
```markdown
## Sources

1. Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. "American Muslim Poll 2023."
   https://ispu.org/american-muslim-poll-2023/

2. Pew Research Center. "Muslim Americans: Demographics and Beliefs." 2024.

## Scholarship Standards

### Not Just Islamic Sources

Draw from best-in-class scholarship across fields:

| Topic | Source Types |
|-------|--------------|
| Charity effectiveness | GiveWell, ImpactMatters, academic philanthropy research |
| Nonprofit finance | Urban Institute, Chronicle of Philanthropy |
| Religious giving | Pew, ISPU, Lilly Family School of Philanthropy |
| Islamic law | Classical texts + contemporary scholars + academic Islamic studies |
| Poverty/development | World Bank, J-PAL, academic economics |

### Handling Disagreement

When scholars disagree, say so clearly:

> "Scholars disagree on whether zakat can fund mosques. The majority view, held by Hanafi and Maliki scholars, says no. Some contemporary scholars argue yes, citing changed circumstances ([Yaqeen Institute, 2022](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/...))."

Never pretend consensus exists when it doesn't.

## Tone Guide

### Do
- Confident but not arrogant
- Clear but not simplistic
- Respectful of reader intelligence
- Direct—get to the point
- Curious—share genuine interest

### Don't
- Preach or lecture
- Use marketing speak
- Hedge excessively ("It could perhaps be argued...")
- Assume reader ignorance
- Use jargon without explanation

### Voice Examples

**Too academic:**
> "The hermeneutical complexities inherent in the exegesis of Quranic injunctions pertaining to zakat distribution necessitate careful consideration of madhab-specific interpretive frameworks."

**Too dumbed-down:**
> "Zakat is like a charity tax. Muslims have to give it. Simple!"

**Just right:**
> "The Quran names eight groups who can receive zakat. But applying 7th-century categories to 21st-century America isn't simple. Does a student drowning in debt count as 'those in bondage'? Scholars still debate this."

## Anti-Patterns

### Opening Crimes
- "In today's world..."
- "Since the beginning of time..."
- "Webster's dictionary defines..."
- "There are many factors to consider..."

### Middle Mush
- Paragraphs that don't advance the argument
- Repetition disguised as emphasis
- Hedging that adds nothing
- "To be sure..." throat-clearing

### Weak Citations
- "Studies show..." (which studies?)
- "Experts say..." (which experts?)
- "Research indicates..." (link it)
- "According to some..." (name them)

### Closing Crimes
- "In conclusion..." (just conclude)
- Restating the intro verbatim
- New information in the conclusion
- Vague calls to action
