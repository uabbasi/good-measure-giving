# Traditional Charity Evaluators

**Note:** These evaluators are useful as **data sources** but are not impact-focused. For evaluation methodology, use GWWC (`giving-what-we-can.md`) and Longview (`longview-methodology.md`).

## The Core Problem

Traditional evaluators focus on overhead and process. GWWC critiques this directly:

> "Even if 100% of your donation goes directly to a charity's program, if that program isn't accomplishing a lot compared to others, then your money won't be either."

## Charity Navigator

The largest evaluator, rating 9,000+ organizations.

### What They Measure

| Beacon | Weight | Components |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Impact & Results | 30% | Program outcomes, goal achievement |
| Accountability & Finance | 40% | Financial health, transparency, audits |
| Leadership & Adaptability | 15% | Board governance, strategic planning |
| Culture & Community | 15% | DEI, stakeholder engagement |

### Scoring Thresholds

| Metric | 4-Star | 3-Star | 2-Star | 1-Star |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Program Expense % | >85% | 75-85% | 65-75% | <65% |
| Admin Expense % | <15% | 15-20% | 20-25% | >25% |
| Fundraising Efficiency | <10% | 10-20% | 20-30% | >30% |

### Useful For

- Quick red flag screening
- Financial ratio data
- Governance indicators
- Beacon awards (accountability signals)

### Limitation

Overhead ratios don't predict program effectiveness.

## CharityWatch

In-depth financial analysis since 1992.

### Grade Criteria

| Grade | Program % | Cost to Raise $100 |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| A+ | >75% | <$25 |
| A | >75% | $25-30 |
| B | 65-70% | $25-35 |
| C | 55-65% | $35-45 |
| F | Financial irregularities |

### Unique Approaches

- Scrutinizes joint cost allocation
- Challenges aggressive "program" claims
- Examines executive compensation
- Reviews related party transactions

### Useful For

- Deep financial due diligence
- Catching accounting manipulation
- Executive compensation analysis

### Limitation

Process-focused, not outcome-focused. Smaller coverage (~600 charities).

## BBB Wise Giving Alliance

20 standards for charitable accountability.

### The 20 Standards (Summary)

| Category | Key Standards |
|----------|---------------|
| Governance | Board oversight, independence, no conflicts |
| Effectiveness | Defined goals, annual review |
| Finances | 65%+ on programs, audited financials, reasonable reserves |
| Fundraising | Truthful solicitations, donor privacy |

### Assessment

Each standard: Met / Not Met / Unable to Verify
Overall: "Meets Standards" requires passing all 20

### Useful For

- Governance due diligence
- Basic accountability check
- Board structure assessment

### Limitation

Binary (no nuance). Doesn't assess actual effectiveness.

## GuideStar / Candid

Transparency-focused nonprofit database.

### Seal Levels

| Level | Requirements | % of Nonprofits |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Bronze | Basic contact, mission, board | ~30% |
| Silver | + Key staff, programs, financials | ~15% |
| Gold | + Goals, strategies, metrics | ~5% |
| Platinum | + Progress, impact, learning | <3% |

### Useful For

- 990 data access
- Basic org info lookup
- Transparency indicator (not effectiveness)

### Limitation

Seals measure disclosure, not effectiveness. A Platinum org could be ineffective but transparent.

## Impact-Focused Evaluators

These evaluate actual program effectiveness:

| Evaluator | Focus | Method |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **GiveWell** | Global health/poverty | Cost-effectiveness modeling, RCTs |
| **Animal Charity Evaluators** | Animal welfare | Program effectiveness research |
| **Giving Green** | Climate | Climate impact analysis |
| **Founders Pledge** | Multiple areas | Research reports |

See `giving-what-we-can.md` for how GWWC integrates these.

## Using Traditional Evaluators Correctly

### Use For (Data Collection)

| Source | Data Value |
|--------|------------|
| Charity Navigator | Financial ratios, beacon status |
| CharityWatch | Deep financial analysis, grade |
| BBB | Governance standards check |
| Candid | 990 data, seal level, transparency |

### Don't Use For (Impact Assessment)

- Comparing charities' actual effectiveness
- Deciding which charity does more good per dollar
- Evaluating program outcomes

### Synthesis Approach

1. **Screen** with traditional evaluators (red flags)
2. **Evaluate** with GWWC/Longview frameworks (impact)
3. **Reference** impact-focused evaluators (GiveWell, ACE)
