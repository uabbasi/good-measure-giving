# Longview Philanthropy Methodology

Professional grantmaking framework from [Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/), representing gold-standard rigor for charity evaluation and donor guidance.

## Five Core Principles

| Principle | Definition | Application to Charity Scoring |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Radical Impartiality** | Every individual counts equally, including future generations | Consider long-term beneficiary impact, not just immediate delivery |
| **Intellectual Honesty** | Transparent about reasoning, assumptions, evidence, and uncertainties | Always disclose what you don't know; include "case against" |
| **Hits-Based Giving** | Accept high failure rate for occasional outsized wins (VC-style) | Appropriate for speculative causes, not reliable service delivery |
| **Win-Win Scenarios** | Seek interventions benefiting present and future | Favor sustainable interventions over one-time relief |
| **Scientific Mindset** | Quantify impact where wisdom permits, rely on latest research | Use data-driven thresholds; acknowledge limits of quantification |

## Five-Stage Grantmaking Process

**Source**: [Longview Grantmaking Process](https://www.longview.org/grantmaking/#our-process)

### Stage 1: Mapping Promising Areas

**Purpose**: Identify fields addressing problems that are huge, tractable, and neglected

**Output**: Prioritized list of sub-fields for investigation

**Application**: Charity list curation, cause area selection

### Stage 2: Grant Investigation (Initial)

**Purpose**: Answer key questions to assess opportunity

| Question | What It Assesses |
|----------|------------------|
| What will the biggest effects be? | Theory of change, impact pathway |
| Is the grant premise valid? | Logical foundation of intervention |
| What's the counterfactual impact? | What happens if we don't fund this? |
| What are organizational strengths/weaknesses? | Capacity assessment |
| Are key personnel competent? | Leadership quality |
| Is it cost-effective? | Efficiency vs alternatives |
| What's the historical track record? | Past performance evidence |
| What are failure modes and downsides? | Risk assessment |

**Output**: Detailed findings + remaining knowledge gaps

**Application**: Baseline evaluation should address most of these

### Stage 3: Grant Investigation (Deep Dive)

**Purpose**: Resolve open questions, finalize assessment

- Update findings from Stage 2
- Document remaining uncertainties
- Finalize budgets and outcome predictions
- Requires minimum 2 team members viewing opportunity as "exceptional"

**Output**: Go/no-go decision with documented rationale

**Application**: Rich evaluation for curated charities

### Stage 4: Recommendation Report

**Purpose**: Communicate findings to decision-makers

| Component | Purpose | Application |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Executive summary with impact pathway | Quick decision support | Narrative summary |
| Supporting evidence and key premises | Justify recommendation | Dimension scores + rationale |
| **Arguments against the grant** | Intellectual honesty | **Risk disclosure section** |
| Quantitative outcome predictions | Set expectations | Expected outcomes |
| Monitoring plan | Accountability framework | Future feature |

**Application**: Rich narrative structure

### Stage 5: Follow-up and Reporting

**Purpose**: Learn and adapt

- Regular check-ins with grantees
- Compare real-world impact vs predictions
- Document lessons learned
- Fresh investigation for renewals

**Application**: Future monitoring feature

## The "Case Against" Requirement

Longview requires explicit documentation of the strongest objections to every grant. This forces intellectual honesty and helps donors make informed decisions.

### Risk Categories

| Category | What to Assess | Examples |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Financial** | Sustainability, concentration | Revenue declined 15% YoY; 80% from one donor |
| **Operational** | Capacity, leadership, geography | CEO transition underway; all ops in one region |
| **Impact** | Evidence gaps, intervention validity | No outcome data; unproven approach |
| **External** | Environment, regulation, politics | Operates in conflict zone; regulatory uncertainty |

### Risk Level Assessment

| Level | Criteria | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| LOW | 0-1 minor concerns | Fund with standard monitoring |
| MODERATE | 2-3 concerns OR 1 significant | Fund with enhanced oversight |
| ELEVATED | Multiple significant concerns | Fund only if high upside potential |
| HIGH | Critical risks identified | Decline or defer |

### Example Risk Disclosure

```
Risks and Concerns:

Financial:
- Revenue concentration: 65% from single government grant expiring 2026
- Working capital below 3-month threshold

Operational:
- Founder-led organization with no documented succession plan
- Recent 40% staff turnover in program team

Impact:
- Beneficiary counts self-reported, not independently verified
- No outcome tracking beyond service delivery

External:
- Primary service area experiencing political instability

Overall Risk Level: ELEVATED
Recommendation: Consider smaller initial grant with milestone-based renewal
```

## Counterfactual Analysis

**Core question**: What happens if this charity doesn't exist?

### Assessment Framework

| Factor | Question | Score Implication |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Geographic uniqueness | Is this the only provider in the region? | Unique = HIGH counterfactual |
| Methodological uniqueness | Does the approach differ from alternatives? | Distinctive = MEDIUM |
| Funding landscape | Is the cause area underfunded or saturated? | Underfunded = HIGH |
| Marginal impact | What does the next dollar achieve? | Binding constraint = HIGH |

### Counterfactual Scores

| Score | Scenario | Donor Implication |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **HIGH** | Charity fills unique gap; no alternatives | Donation creates impact that wouldn't happen otherwise |
| **MEDIUM** | Some alternatives but distinctive approach | Donation accelerates or improves impact |
| **LOW** | Many well-funded alternatives | Donation may displace other funding |

### Questions to Ask

1. If this charity closed, would beneficiaries be served by someone else?
2. Are there other organizations doing similar work in the same area?
3. Is this charity's approach meaningfully different from alternatives?
4. Is there a clear funding gap in this space?

## Uncertainty Disclosure

Longview emphasizes being "transparent about uncertainties rather than telling donors what they want to hear."

### Disclosure Components

| Component | What to Include |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Data completeness | "Based on 3 of 5 data sources; missing audited financials" |
| Evidence quality | "Outcome claims based on self-reported surveys, not independent evaluation" |
| Score confidence | "HIGH confidence in financial metrics; LOW confidence in impact claims" |
| Key unknowns | "Unable to verify beneficiary counts; cost-per-beneficiary is estimate" |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Definition | When to Apply |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| HIGH | Multiple independent sources confirm | Cross-verified data |
| MEDIUM | Single reliable source OR consistent self-reporting | Standard case |
| LOW | Limited data OR potential conflicts | Gaps or red flags |
| VERY LOW | Unable to verify OR conflicting information | Significant uncertainty |

## Comparative Context

Don't just report metrics—provide peer comparison to help donors calibrate.

### Without Context (Weak)

```
Program Expense Ratio: 78%
Cost per Beneficiary: $127
Beneficiaries Served: 15,000
```

### With Longview-Style Context (Strong)

```
Program Expense Ratio: 78%
  → Above sector median (72%) for food security organizations
  → Ranks in top 30% of similar-sized nonprofits

Cost per Beneficiary: $127
  → Sector median: $200/person for food security programs
  → 37% more efficient than peer average
  → Note: "Beneficiary" = households, not individuals

Beneficiaries Served: 15,000 households
  → Mid-range for organizations of this revenue ($5-10M)
  → Growing at 12% annually (sector average: 5%)
```

### Comparison Sources

| Metric | Comparison Benchmark |
|--------|---------------------|
| Financial ratios | Charity Navigator sector averages |
| Cost-effectiveness | GiveWell benchmarks where available |
| Scale | Revenue-adjusted peer comparison |
| Growth | Historical trend + sector average |

## When Longview Approach Applies

### Strong Fit

- Major donor decisions ($10K+)
- Curated charity recommendations
- Rich/detailed evaluation tier
- Sophisticated donors seeking rigor

### Partial Fit

- Baseline screening (use simplified version)
- Smaller donations (reduce depth, keep principles)
- Faith-based evaluation (adapt for zakat context)

### Not Applicable

- Hits-based/speculative giving (zakat requires certainty)
- Existential risk focus (zakat targets immediate need)
- 100-year time horizons (zakat is annual obligation)

## Application to Two-Tier Evaluation

### Baseline Evaluation (All Charities)

Adopt these Longview elements:
- Stage 2 investigation questions (simplified)
- Data completeness disclosure
- Basic uncertainty flags

Skip these for baseline:
- Full counterfactual analysis
- Detailed risk disclosure
- Comparative context
- Quantitative predictions

### Rich Evaluation (Curated ~70 Charities)

Adopt full Longview rigor:
- Complete Stage 2 + Stage 3 investigation
- **"Case Against" risk section (required)**
- Counterfactual/replaceability assessment
- Full uncertainty disclosure
- Peer comparative context
- Outcome expectations
