# Giving What We Can Methodology

[Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) (GWWC) is a community of donors committed to effective giving. Founded in 2009, they've moved $522M+ to high-impact charities through 10,500+ pledgers across 118 countries.

## Core Philosophy

### The Central Insight

**Not all charities are equal.** Research shows the most effective charities can be **30x more impactful** than less effective ones pursuing identical goals.

> "The difference between good and great can be substantial... some charities are significantly more impactful than others."

### Impact vs Overhead

GWWC explicitly rejects overhead-based evaluation:

> "Some charity evaluations focus less on impact and more on metrics like overhead, which we think doesn't capture the full story."
>
> "Even if 100% of your donation goes directly to a charity's program, if that program isn't accomplishing a lot compared to others, then your money won't be either."

**Key distinction**: Traditional evaluators (Charity Navigator, GuideStar) measure organizational health. Impact-focused evaluators measure **actual program effectiveness**.

## Two-Step Evaluation Framework

**Source**: [Effective Giving 101](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/effective-giving-101)

### Step 1: Identify High-Impact Causes

Apply the **ITN Framework**:

| Factor | Question | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Scale** | How many affected, how severely? | Malaria kills 600,000/year |
| **Neglectedness** | Is it underfunded relative to scale? | Neglected tropical diseases |
| **Tractability** | Are there proven solutions? | Malaria nets are highly effective |

### Step 2: Select Effective Organizations

| Indicator | What to Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Evidence-based approach | RCTs, rigorous evaluation |
| Cost-effectiveness | Impact per dollar vs alternatives |
| Transparency | Open about methods and failures |
| Room for funding | Can absorb more productively |
| Track record | History of achieving outcomes |

**Not reliable indicators**: Low overhead, celebrity endorsements, emotional appeals

## Cost-Effectiveness Benchmarks

**Source**: [The Power of Effective Giving](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/an-introduction-to-the-power-of-effective-giving)

### Illustrative Costs

| Intervention | Approximate Cost |
|--------------|------------------|
| Clean water for 10 children (1 year) | $15 |
| Malaria net for one child | $5 |
| **Save one life** (evidence-based interventions) | ~$5,000 |

### Comparative Context

| Benchmark | Cost per Life |
|-----------|---------------|
| Top effective charities | ~$5,000 |
| High-income government programs | ~$10,000,000 |
| **Multiplier** | 2,000x more efficient |

### The Comparison Problem

Identical goals, vastly different efficiency:

| Intervention | Cost | Implication |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Cataract surgery | ~$1,000/treatment | Restores sight |
| Guide dog training | $30,000-$50,000/dog | Also addresses blindness |
| **Difference** | 30-50x | Same goal, huge variance |

> "Any dollar donated to one charity cannot go to another."

## Charity Comparison Methodology

**Source**: [Charity Comparisons](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity-comparisons)

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cost-effectiveness per outcome** | How much impact per dollar? |
| **Independent verification** | Evaluated by GiveWell, ACE, etc.? |
| **Geographic context** | Where does money go furthest? |
| **Scale of impact** | How many lives/beings affected? |

### The Cash Benchmark

GWWC references GiveWell's benchmark:

> "Only recommends charities that it believes are at least twice as cost-effective as GiveDirectly style cash transfers."

**GiveDirectly** = unconditional cash to extreme poor
**Threshold** = Must be ≥2x cash to recommend (GiveWell uses ≥10x for top charities)

### Five Decision Principles

1. **Support independently evaluated programs** - Don't trust self-reported impact
2. **Help where marginal resources create greatest impact** - Diminishing returns matter
3. **Find cost-effective programs within cause areas** - Efficiency varies within causes
4. **Identify leverage opportunities** - Multiplier effects
5. **Expand moral concern** - Consider all who can be helped

## Impact-Focused Evaluators

**Source**: [What Are Impact-Focused Charity Evaluators](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/what-are-impact-focused-charity-evaluators)

### Definition

Organizations that research **actual program effectiveness**, examining:
1. **Does it work?** - Program effectiveness
2. **How much good per dollar?** - Cost-effectiveness
3. **How does it compare?** - Relative to alternatives

### Evaluator Landscape

| Evaluator | Focus Area | Approach |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **GiveWell** | Global health/poverty | Deep cost-effectiveness modeling |
| **Animal Charity Evaluators** | Animal welfare | Program effectiveness research |
| **Giving Green** | Climate change | Climate impact analysis |
| **Founders Pledge** | Multiple areas | Research for pledged donors |
| **EA Funds** | Multiple areas | Expert-directed grantmaking |

### Traditional vs Impact-Focused

| Aspect | Traditional (CN, GuideStar) | Impact-Focused (GiveWell, ACE) |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Primary metric | Overhead ratio, transparency | Cost-effectiveness |
| Question answered | "Is this org well-run?" | "Does this program work?" |
| Data sources | 990s, self-reported | RCTs, meta-analyses, site visits |
| Coverage | 9,000+ charities | Dozens (deep analysis) |
| Limitation | Doesn't assess effectiveness | Narrow focus, few rated |

## Evidence Standards

### GiveWell Research Approach

GWWC endorses GiveWell's methodology:

- **Randomized Controlled Trials** (gold standard)
- **Meta-analyses** (synthesize multiple studies)
- **Rigorous data** over intuition or marketing

### Disease Control Priorities

GWWC cites the **DCP report** showing dramatic cost-effectiveness variation across health interventions—supporting their claim that intervention choice matters enormously.

## The Pledge Model

### How It Works

| Pledge Level | Commitment |
|--------------|------------|
| **10% Pledge** | 10% of income to effective charities |
| **Try Giving** | 1%+ for any time period |
| **Further Pledge** | Significant portion of income/wealth |
| **Company Pledge** | 10%+ of profits |

### Collective Impact

- **10,500+ members** across 118 countries
- **$522M+ pledged** (documented)
- **$338M tracked** through pledge system

### Why Pledging Works

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Public commitment | Increases follow-through |
| Community | Peer support and accountability |
| Identity | "Effective giver" becomes part of self |
| Normalization | Makes significant giving mainstream |

## Application to Charity Scoring

### What to Adopt

| GWWC Element | Application |
|--------------|-------------|
| Impact > overhead | Don't over-weight financial ratios |
| Cash benchmark | Compare to GiveDirectly as floor |
| ITN framework | Assess cause-level importance |
| 30x variance claim | Justify rigorous evaluation |
| Evaluator reliance | Weight GiveWell/ACE ratings highly |

### What to Adapt for Zakat

| GWWC Approach | Zakat Adaptation |
|---------------|------------------|
| Cause-neutral | Fixed zakat categories (8 asnaf) |
| Global optimization | May prioritize local/Muslim communities |
| Long-term focus | Immediate need also valid |
| Animal welfare inclusion | Traditional zakat is human-focused |

### Scoring Implications

1. **Don't penalize moderate overhead** if impact is demonstrated
2. **Prefer independently evaluated** charities when available
3. **Use cost-effectiveness benchmarks** (with cause-area adjustment)
4. **Acknowledge evidence quality** in confidence scores
5. **Reference GiveWell** for global health charities

## ITN Framework in Detail

The core framework for cause prioritization, used throughout the effective giving community.

### The Three Factors

```
Expected Impact = Importance × Tractability × Neglectedness
```

**Importance (Scale)**
- How many people/beings affected?
- How severe is the harm?
- How much could the world improve?

**Tractability (Solvability)**
- Are there proven interventions?
- What's the marginal return on effort?
- Is success measurable?

**Neglectedness (Crowdedness)**
- How much funding already exists?
- How many people working on it?
- Have the easy wins been captured?

### ITN Applied to Cause Areas

| Cause Area | Importance | Tractability | Neglectedness | Overall |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Global health | High | High | Medium | **Strong** |
| Climate change | Very High | Medium | Low | Medium |
| AI safety | Potentially Very High | Low-Medium | High | Uncertain |
| Local poverty | Medium | High | Low | Medium |

### Limitations of ITN

- **Neglectedness paradox**: Very neglected may mean intractable
- **Importance subjectivity**: How to weight different suffering?
- **Tractability uncertainty**: Unknown for new/speculative areas
- **Discounts local value**: Community ties don't fit the framework

## Major Cause Areas

### Global Health & Poverty

**Why it scores well:**
- Strong evidence base (RCTs)
- Clear metrics (lives saved, DALYs)
- Extreme cost-effectiveness ($3-5k per life)
- Urgent, solvable suffering

**Key interventions:**
- Malaria prevention (nets, treatment)
- Deworming
- Vitamin A supplementation
- Direct cash transfers
- Vaccine delivery

**Top evaluators:** GiveWell, J-PAL

### Disaster Relief & Humanitarian

**Considerations:**
- Speed matters
- Local partners often most effective
- Cash often better than goods
- Long-term recovery vs immediate relief

### Zakat-Eligible Causes

For Muslim donors, zakat has specific eligible categories:

| Category | Modern Applications |
|----------|---------------------|
| Fuqara/Masakin (Poor/Needy) | Poverty relief, food security |
| Gharimin (Indebted) | Debt relief, medical debt |
| Ibn al-Sabil (Wayfarers) | Refugee assistance |
| Fi Sabilillah (God's cause) | Varies by interpretation |

See `zakat-fiqh` skill for detailed fiqh guidance.

## Key Takeaways

1. **30x variance** between best and average charities in same cause
2. **Overhead is not a proxy** for effectiveness
3. **Cash transfers are the benchmark** (must beat GiveDirectly)
4. **Independent evaluation matters** more than self-reporting
5. **Geographic arbitrage** - money goes further in poor countries
6. **~$5,000 to save a life** at top charities (vs $10M for governments)
7. **ITN framework** guides cause prioritization
