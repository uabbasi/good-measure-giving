# Evidence-Based Giving Expert

Expert guidance on impact-focused charity evaluation, anchored on **Giving What We Can** and **Longview Philanthropy** methodologies.

## When This Skill Activates

- Designing or modifying charity evaluation criteria
- Writing donor guidance or recommendations
- Building scoring algorithms for charity assessment
- Analyzing cost-effectiveness or impact metrics
- Comparing charities across different cause areas

## Core Principles (GWWC + Longview)

### The Central Insight

**Not all charities are equal.** The best charities are **30x more effective** than average charities pursuing identical goals. Rigorous evaluation identifies these differences.

### Impact Over Overhead

Traditional evaluators focus on overhead ratios. This is wrong:

> "Even if 100% of your donation goes directly to a charity's program, if that program isn't accomplishing a lot compared to others, then your money won't be either." — GWWC

### The Cash Benchmark

**GiveDirectly** (unconditional cash transfers) is the floor:
- GWWC threshold: ≥2x cash to recommend
- GiveWell threshold: ≥10x cash for "top charity"

### Key Cost-Effectiveness Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost to save one life (top charities) | ~$5,000 |
| Cost to save one life (government programs) | ~$10,000,000 |
| Multiplier | 2,000x |

## Primary Frameworks

### Giving What We Can (GWWC)

See `resources/giving-what-we-can.md` for complete methodology.

**Two-Step Framework:**
1. **Identify high-impact causes** using ITN (Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness)
2. **Select effective organizations** based on evidence, cost-effectiveness, transparency

**Key Contributions:**
- 30x variance claim between best and average charities
- Cash transfer benchmark for cost-effectiveness
- Impact-focused evaluator network (GiveWell, ACE, Giving Green)
- Pledge community (10,500+ members, $522M+ moved)

### Longview Philanthropy

See `resources/longview-methodology.md` for complete methodology.

**Five Principles:**
1. Radical Impartiality — future beneficiaries count equally
2. **Intellectual Honesty** — disclose uncertainties; include "case against"
3. Hits-Based Giving — accept failures for occasional big wins
4. Win-Win Scenarios — favor sustainable interventions
5. **Scientific Mindset** — quantify impact; acknowledge limits

**Five-Stage Grant Process:**
1. Map promising areas (ITN prioritization)
2. Initial investigation (counterfactual, track record, risks)
3. Deep dive (resolve uncertainties, predictions)
4. Recommendation report (impact pathway + "case against")
5. Follow-up (actual vs predicted; learn)

**Critical Elements Often Missing:**

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **"Case Against"** | Document strongest objections to funding |
| **Counterfactual** | What happens if charity doesn't exist? |
| **Uncertainty Disclosure** | Confidence levels for all claims |
| **Comparative Context** | Metrics vs peer benchmarks |

## The ITN Framework

For cause-level prioritization:

```
Expected Impact = Importance × Tractability × Neglectedness
```

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Importance** | How many affected? How severely? |
| **Tractability** | Are there proven solutions? |
| **Neglectedness** | Is it underfunded relative to scale? |

See `resources/giving-what-we-can.md` for application details.

## Evidence Quality Hierarchy

| Tier | Evidence Type | Confidence |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Randomized Controlled Trials | Highest |
| 2 | Quasi-experimental studies | High |
| 3 | Observational with controls | Medium |
| 4 | Pre/post comparisons | Low-Medium |
| 5 | Expert opinion/track record | Low |
| 6 | Anecdotes/testimonials | Lowest |

## Traditional Evaluators (Data Sources Only)

These provide useful data but are **not impact-focused**:

| Evaluator | Useful For | Limitation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Charity Navigator | Financial ratios, governance flags | Overhead ≠ effectiveness |
| CharityWatch | Deep financial analysis | Process over outcomes |
| BBB Wise Giving | Governance standards | Binary, no impact measure |
| Candid/GuideStar | Transparency seals, 990 data | Disclosure ≠ effectiveness |

Use these for **data collection**, not **impact assessment**.

## Impact-Focused Evaluators

Rely on these for effectiveness judgments:

| Evaluator | Focus Area |
|-----------|-----------|
| **GiveWell** | Global health/poverty (gold standard) |
| **Animal Charity Evaluators** | Animal welfare |
| **Giving Green** | Climate change |
| **Founders Pledge** | Multiple areas |

## Charity Red Flags

Quick screening (not impact assessment):

| Signal | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| Program expense ratio < 65% | Financial health |
| No audited financials (>$500k revenue) | Governance |
| Board < 5 members, family-dominated | Independence |
| Only testimonials as evidence | Impact claims |
| High executive turnover | Stability |

## Writing Donor Guidance

### Principles

1. **Impact over overhead** — don't penalize moderate admin costs
2. **Acknowledge uncertainty** — state confidence levels
3. **Comparative context** — "37% more efficient than sector median"
4. **Include "case against"** — intellectual honesty
5. **Respect donor values** — informative, not prescriptive

### Zakat Adaptation

| GWWC/Longview Approach | Zakat Adaptation |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Cause-neutral optimization | Fixed 8 asnaf categories |
| Global optimization | May prioritize Muslim communities |
| Long-term framing | Immediate need also valid |
