# Madhab Differences on Zakat

How the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (madhahib) differ on zakat rulings. Understanding these differences is essential for providing accurate, nuanced guidance to donors.

## Overview

The four madhabs agree on the fundamental obligation of zakat and the eight categories (asnaf) from Quran 9:60. They differ on:

1. **Definitions** - Who qualifies for each category
2. **Priorities** - Order of distribution
3. **Amounts** - How much each recipient should receive
4. **Restrictions** - Who is excluded
5. **Modern applications** - How to interpret categories today

## School Comparison Table

| Issue | Hanafi | Maliki | Shafi'i | Hanbali |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Fuqara vs Masakin severity | Fuqara worse | Masakin worse | Fuqara worse | Fuqara worse |
| Mu'allafatu Qulubuhum | Suspended | Active | Active | Active |
| Fi Sabilillah scope | Jihad only | Jihad only | Jihad (+ some expansion) | Jihad + Hajj + education |
| Hajj from zakat | No | No | No | Yes (if poor) |
| Transfer to other localities | Makruh (disliked) | Permitted | Makruh | Permitted if need |
| Must cover all 8 categories | No | No | Yes | No |
| Zakat to Hashimites | Prohibited | Prohibited | Prohibited | Prohibited |

## Detailed Differences by Category

### 1. Al-Fuqara (The Poor) vs Al-Masakin (The Needy)

This is one of the most debated distinctions.

**Hanafi Position**
- **Fuqara** = Have nothing or below nisab
- **Masakin** = Have something but insufficient
- **Fuqara are worse off** - completely destitute

**Maliki Position**
- **Fuqara** = Have something but below nisab
- **Masakin** = Have absolutely nothing, may beg
- **Masakin are worse off** - totally destitute

**Shafi'i Position**
- **Fuqara** = Have less than 50% of their needs met
- **Masakin** = Have 50-99% of needs met
- **Fuqara are worse off** - further from sufficiency
- Uses mathematical threshold (50%)

**Hanbali Position**
- Similar to Shafi'i
- **Fuqara** = Have less than half their needs
- **Masakin** = Have half to most of their needs
- **Fuqara are worse off**

**Practical Impact**: Despite the linguistic debate, both categories receive zakat. The distinction matters for understanding severity and prioritization.

### 2. Al-Amilin Alayha (Zakat Administrators)

All schools agree administrators can receive from zakat, but differ on details.

**Hanafi Position**
- Must be appointed by legitimate Islamic authority (imam/state)
- Self-appointed collectors cannot take from zakat
- Compensation based on work performed, not percentage

**Maliki Position**
- Administrators receive fair wages for their work
- Can include guards, accountants, distributors
- Strictest on requiring state appointment

**Shafi'i Position**
- Administrators receive what they need for their work
- Includes those who collect, record, guard, and distribute
- Can receive even if wealthy (payment for service)

**Hanbali Position**
- Most flexible on who qualifies as administrator
- Includes all involved in zakat collection/distribution
- Compensation proportional to effort

**Modern Application**: The 12.5% (1/8th) administrative cap is a modern derivation, not a classical ruling. It's based on administrators being one of eight categories.

### 3. Al-Mu'allafatu Qulubuhum (Those Whose Hearts Are Reconciled)

**Major Debate**: Is this category still active or suspended?

**Hanafi Position (Minority)**
- Category is **suspended** (mansukh)
- Based on Umar ibn al-Khattab's ruling during his caliphate
- Reasoning: Islam is now established, doesn't need to "buy" support
- Some later Hanafi scholars allow in specific circumstances

**Maliki Position**
- Category **remains active**
- New Muslims can receive support
- Those who protect Muslim interests qualify
- Cannot use for outright bribery or coercion

**Shafi'i Position**
- Category **remains active**
- Applies to new Muslims needing support
- Those whose support benefits Muslim community
- Requires genuine benefit, not manipulation

**Hanbali Position**
- Category **remains active**
- Most expansive interpretation
- Includes potential Muslims showing interest
- Can strengthen weak Muslims' faith

**Codebase Relevance**: When charities serve new Muslim communities or da'wah programs, note the Hanafi vs majority position.

### 4. Fi Al-Riqab (Freeing Those in Bondage)

**Classical Agreement**: All schools agree this applies to freeing slaves.

**Modern Divergence**:

**Conservative View** (some scholars across madhabs)
- Category is dormant since chattel slavery ended
- Cannot be expanded to modern situations
- Funds should go to other categories

**Majority Contemporary View**
- Principle applies to modern forms of bondage:
  - Human trafficking victims
  - Bonded laborers
  - Those in exploitative conditions
- Must genuinely be bondage-like situations

**Note**: This category has the least madhab-specific differences since the underlying condition (slavery) has largely been abolished.

### 5. Al-Gharimin (Those in Debt)

**Types of Debtors**

All schools recognize two sub-categories:

1. **Gharim li-nafsihi** - Personal debt for own/family needs
2. **Gharim li-ghairihi** - Debt for community benefit (mediating disputes)

**Hanafi Position**
- Debtor must be Muslim
- Debt must be for halal purposes
- Cannot own excess wealth (above nisab)
- Zakat pays debt directly or to debtor

**Maliki Position**
- Strictest requirements
- Debt must be currently due
- Cannot be for luxury or haram
- Some allow giving to creditor on debtor's behalf

**Shafi'i Position**
- Debt must be for permissible purposes
- Debtor must be unable to repay
- Can receive even if has some assets (but not enough to pay)
- Distinguishes between types of debt

**Hanbali Position**
- Most lenient on debt eligibility
- Includes debt for Hajj (disputed)
- Community debtors can receive even if wealthy
- Emphasis on genuine inability to repay

### 6. Fi Sabilillah (In the Cause of Allah)

**The Most Contentious Category**

This category has the widest range of interpretations.

**Hanafi Position**
- **Strictly limited to jihad** (armed defense of Islam)
- Mujahideen who cannot afford to fight
- Military equipment and supplies
- Some scholars include impoverished Hajj pilgrims
- **Does NOT include**: mosques, schools, general charity

**Maliki Position**
- **Most restrictive interpretation**
- Jihad and border defense only
- Guards of Muslim territories
- Explicit exclusion of Hajj, schools, mosques
- Reason: Quran uses specific language "fi sabilillah"

**Shafi'i Position**
- **Primarily jihad**
- Fighters can receive even if wealthy
- Military equipment and fortifications
- Some scholars expand to:
  - Students of Islamic knowledge
  - Da'wah workers
- **Debated**: mosques, Islamic schools

**Hanbali Position**
- **Most expansive interpretation**
- Jihad (primary meaning)
- **Hajj for those who cannot afford** (distinctive position)
- Students of Islamic knowledge
- Some extend to:
  - Building mosques (minority view)
  - Islamic education
  - Da'wah programs

**Summary Table: Fi Sabilillah Scope**

| Activity | Hanafi | Maliki | Shafi'i | Hanbali |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Jihad/Defense | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Hajj (poor) | Some | No | No | Yes |
| Islamic students | No | No | Some | Yes |
| Mosque building | No | No | Disputed | Minority yes |
| General charity | No | No | No | No |

### 7. Ibn Al-Sabil (The Wayfarer)

**Core Agreement**: All schools agree this applies to stranded travelers.

**Hanafi Position**
- Traveler must be Muslim
- Travel must be for permissible purpose
- Stranded = cannot access their wealth
- Give only what's needed to reach destination
- Can receive even if wealthy at home

**Maliki Position**
- Similar to Hanafi
- Emphasis on the journey being halal
- Cannot be traveling for sinful purposes
- Temporary assistance only

**Shafi'i Position**
- Most detailed conditions
- Travel purpose must be permissible
- Give enough to complete journey
- If wealthy at home, should arrange repayment
- Includes those starting a journey without funds

**Hanbali Position**
- Most flexible interpretation
- Includes those wanting to travel for good purpose
- Not just currently stranded
- Can include students studying away from home

**Modern Application**:
- All agree: refugees, disaster evacuees qualify
- Debated: economic migrants, illegal border crossers (travel permissibility question)

## Distribution Rules

### Must Zakat Cover All 8 Categories?

**Shafi'i Position (Distinctive)**
- **Must distribute to all 8 categories** if they exist in the locality
- At least 3 people per category
- Cannot give entire zakat to one category
- Exception: if a category doesn't exist locally

**Hanafi, Maliki, Hanbali Position**
- **May give to one category or even one person**
- Sufficient to give to any of the eight
- Priority based on need
- More practical for individual donors

### Priority Among Categories

**General Agreement** (with variations):
1. Fuqara and Masakin (poverty relief first)
2. Gharimin (debt relief)
3. Ibn al-Sabil (immediate need)
4. Fi al-Riqab (if applicable)
5. Fi Sabilillah (varies by interpretation)
6. Amilin (administrative)
7. Mu'allafatu Qulubuhum (if applicable)

### Local vs Distant Distribution

**Hanafi Position**
- Zakat should stay local (makruh to transfer)
- Exception: sending to relatives
- Exception: greater need elsewhere

**Maliki Position**
- Transfer permitted
- Local poor have no absolute priority
- Can send where need is greatest

**Shafi'i Position**
- Prefers local distribution
- Transfer is makruh (disliked)
- Permitted for specific purposes

**Hanbali Position**
- Local preferred but not required
- Transfer permitted if greater need elsewhere
- Relatives in other localities can receive

## Exclusions (Agreed by All)

These groups **cannot** receive zakat across all madhabs:

1. **Wealthy (above nisab)** - Exception: amilin, mujahideen
2. **Descendants of Prophet (Hashimites)** - Banu Hashim
3. **One's own dependents** - Spouse, children, parents you're obligated to support
4. **Non-Muslims** - For obligatory zakat (sadaqah is different)
5. **Those who misuse** - Known to use for haram purposes

## Practical Guidance for Codebase

### When Assessing Charity Programs

| Program Type | Zakat Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Direct poverty relief | Clear ✓ | All madhabs agree |
| Debt relief | Clear ✓ | Verify halal debt purpose |
| Refugee aid | Clear ✓ | Ibn al-sabil + fuqara overlap |
| Islamic education | Depends | Hanbali yes, others disputed |
| Mosque building | Disputed | Only some Hanbalis allow |
| General healthcare | Depends | Only if serving poor specifically |
| Environmental work | Not eligible | Not among 8 categories |

### Donor Guidance Language

When madhabs differ significantly:

> "Scholars differ on whether [activity] qualifies for zakat funds. The Hanbali school permits this under fi sabilillah, while other schools take a more restrictive view. We recommend consulting your local imam for guidance on your specific obligation."

### Self-Assertion Approach

The codebase uses charity self-assertion for zakat eligibility:
- Report what charities claim
- Note when claims may be contested
- Don't make independent rulings
- Recommend scholar consultation
