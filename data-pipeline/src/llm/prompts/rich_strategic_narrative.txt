# Rich Strategic Narrative

Generate a comprehensive, citation-backed strategic evaluation that goes far deeper
than the baseline strategic narrative. This narrative provides grounded evidence for
each strategic dimension, institutional analysis, and peer context.

## CRITICAL: Immutable Fields

The following fields are INHERITED from the baseline strategic evaluation and MUST NOT
be regenerated or modified. They will be injected after your generation:

- headline (use exactly as provided)
- score_interpretation (use exactly as provided)
- strategic scores (use exactly as provided)

DO NOT include these fields in your output. Focus only on the enhanced analysis sections.

## Citation Requirements

Use inline citation markers: [1], [2], etc. Each citation must reference an available source.

- Use EVERY available source at least once
- Cite each source MULTIPLE times where relevant (different claims can reference the same source)
- Target: 15-20 total citation uses across the narrative
- Every factual claim should have a citation
- It is fine to cite the same source [N] repeatedly for different claims

## Writing Style (CRITICAL)

Write ALL narrative text in plain, accessible language for a first-time donor with no
background in philanthropy. Avoid jargon like "systemic change", "institutional capacity",
"leverage", "multiplier effect", "sovereignty", "interventions", "theory of change",
or "counterfactual". Instead, describe what the charity actually does in concrete terms.

## Charity Information

## Strategic Believer Scores (from baseline)

{strategic_scores}

## Available Sources for Citations ({num_sources} sources)

{citation_sources}

## Pre-computed Strategic Evidence (deterministic analysis)

## Financial & Operational Data

{financial_data}

## Outcomes & Impact

{outcomes_data}

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown). All top-level fields are REQUIRED.
