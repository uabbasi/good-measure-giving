## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR BASIC NEEDS ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)
- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Innovative models replicated globally (e.g., Water.org's WaterCredit), addressing root causes of need
- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Large-scale infrastructure (water systems, food networks), policy influence
- 12-19 (REGIONAL): Sustainable programs, some capacity building, multi-region reach
- 6-11 (LOCAL): Direct service delivery, limited structural change
- 0-5 (CONSUMPTIVE): One-time distributions only

### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components

**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?
- 7-8: Innovative model (Water.org's WaterCredit), unique infrastructure
- 5-6: Few alternatives in specific region
- 3-4: Other orgs doing similar work (most water/food orgs)
- 1-2: Many organizations doing generic distribution
- 0: Instantly replaceable commodity services

**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?
- 5-6: Serving Muslim-majority regions (MENA, South Asia)
- 3-4: Mixed populations including Muslim communities
- 1-2: General basic needs with limited Muslim focus

**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?
- 5-6: Innovative approaches, chronic needs (vs. seasonal campaigns)
- 3-4: Some funding but moderate attention
- 1-2: Well-funded (Ramadan food, Qurbani)
- 0: Oversaturated seasonal campaigns

### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components

**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability
- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, supply chain controls, strong governance
- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure
- 0-3: Weak accountability

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: Multi-country=3, National=2, Regional=1, Local=0
- Zakat: Direct aid to poor qualifies (3 typical for basic needs orgs)

### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components

**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they do?
- 7-8: Real-time distribution tracking, GPS-tagged projects (charity:water)
- 5-6: Annual reports with wells/meals/beneficiaries
- 3-4: Basic distribution counts
- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions
- 0: No metrics

**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Did conditions actually improve?
- 9-10: Malnutrition reduction, water access rates, child development tracked
- 7-8: Health outcomes linked to intervention
- 5-6: Some outcome indicators (water quality testing)
- 3-4: Outputs only ("wells dug"), no outcome measurement
- 0-2: No outcome tracking

**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?
- 6-7: Independent evaluations, water quality testing, GPS verification
- 4-5: Third-party audits
- 2-3: Standard financial audit only
- 0-1: Limited external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**Water.org vs. generic well-drilling:**
- Water.org: Microfinance model creating sustainable access = 26-30 Systemic Leverage
- Generic well-drilling: One-time infrastructure = 6-14 Systemic Leverage

**Orphan sponsorship programs:**
- Usually 6-11 on Systemic Leverage (direct support without structural change)
- Higher if building permanent children's institutions
