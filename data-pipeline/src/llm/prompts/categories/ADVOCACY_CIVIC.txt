## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**Same rubric applies regardless of political perspective:**
- Emgage (Muslim civic engagement) and ACT for America (different perspective) both measured on effectiveness, not ideology
- Score based on: Does the advocacy work? Does it produce measurable outcomes?

**Effectiveness is the standard:**
- An effective advocacy org from any perspective scores higher than an ineffective one
