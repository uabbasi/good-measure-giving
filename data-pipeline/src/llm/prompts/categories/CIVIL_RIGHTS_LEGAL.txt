## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR CIVIL RIGHTS/LEGAL ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)

- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: National network=3, Multi-state=2, Single state=1, Local=0
- Zakat: Legal aid for poor can qualify (0-2 typical for civil rights orgs)

- 0-1: Limited external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**CAIR and similar orgs typically score 12-19 on Systemic Leverage:**
- State-level work, important advocacy, but not achieving ACLU-level federal precedents
- To score 20+, must demonstrate federal court victories or national legislation influenced

**Difference from ACLU/NAACP LDF:**
- ACLU: Has won dozens of Supreme Court cases
- NAACP LDF: Brown v. Board, Loving v. Virginia - paradigm-shifting precedents
- Most Muslim civil rights orgs: Important local/state work, not yet at that tier

**Same rubric applies regardless of whose rights the org claims to defend.**
