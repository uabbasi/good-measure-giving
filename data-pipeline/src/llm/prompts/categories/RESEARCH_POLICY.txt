## WORLD-CLASS BENCHMARKS
Compare this charity against these best-in-class research/policy organizations:
- Brookings Institution: Foundational policy research, shapes legislative debates
- Pew Research Center: Gold standard for polling and data, universally cited
- RAND Corporation: Rigorous analysis, methodology widely adopted
- Urban Institute: Evidence-based policy research, longitudinal studies
- Heritage Foundation: Effective policy advocacy, legislative influence

## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR RESEARCH/POLICY ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)
- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Research that shapes paradigms globally, methodology adopted as THE standard in the field. Requires: $50M+ budget, 100+ researchers, decades of foundational work. Examples: Pew's polling methodology is THE standard; Brookings shapes federal policy at the highest levels; RAND's analysis methods are adopted by governments worldwide.
- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Research regularly cited in Congressional testimony, influencing national policy debates, recognized as authoritative in a specific domain. Budget $5-50M.
- 12-19 (REGIONAL/NICHE): Research used by state/local policymakers or authoritative within a specific community. Budget $1-5M, cited by other organizations.
- 6-11 (LOCAL): Research with limited policy uptake, primarily internal use
- 0-5 (MINIMAL): Opinion pieces without research rigor

### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components

**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?
- 7-8: Creates foundational data others depend on (ISPU's Muslim polling, Pew's methodology)
- 5-6: Authoritative in specific niche, few alternatives
- 3-4: Some alternatives exist in the space
- 1-2: Many organizations cover similar topics
- 0: Easily replaced by existing research

**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?
- 5-6: Research on American Muslim community, Islamophobia, Muslim-majority countries
- 3-4: Research affecting Muslims among other groups
- 1-2: General policy research with limited Muslim relevance
- 0: No Muslim-specific focus

**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?
- 5-6: Research infrastructure systematically ignored (longitudinal studies, data collection)
- 3-4: Some funding but below need (policy analysis, academic work)
- 1-2: Well-funded research areas
- 0: Oversaturated with funding

### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components

**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability
- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, peer-review processes, strong research governance
- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure
- 0-3: Weak accountability

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: National research impact=2, Regional=1, Local=0 (Note: research orgs rarely score 3 since geographic reach differs from humanitarian)
- Zakat: Most research not zakat-eligible (0-1 typical)

### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components

**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they produce?
- 7-8: Publication metrics, citation tracking, media mentions dashboard
- 5-6: Annual reports with research outputs and citations
- 3-4: Basic publication counts
- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions
- 0: No output metrics

**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Do they measure policy/behavioral change?
- 9-10: Documented policy changes attributable to research
- 7-8: Research cited in legislation, court decisions, or policy debates
- 5-6: Policy citations, media uptake as proxy for influence
- 3-4: Academic citations only, limited policy impact
- 0-2: No outcome measurement

**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?
- 6-7: Peer-reviewed publications, methodology adopted by others
- 4-5: External methodology reviews, academic partnerships
- 2-3: Standard financial audit only
- 0-1: Limited or no external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**ISPU expected scores:**
- Systemic Leverage: 15-19 (REGIONAL/NICHE) - Authoritative within Muslim American research niche, but $1.6M budget is 60x smaller than Pew. Not yet at NATIONAL tier.
- Ummah Gap: 16-20 (FOUNDATIONAL) - Creates polling data that didn't exist before. This is genuine infrastructure work.
- Expected total: 72-80

**Scale matters for Systemic Leverage:**
- Pew ($100M) vs ISPU ($1.6M) = 60x difference
- You cannot score 26-30 with a $1.6M budget
- Quality research at small scale = 12-19, not 20+

**Heritage Foundation is a BENCHMARK (not disqualified):**
- World-class at policy influence regardless of ideology
- Methodology and effectiveness are the standards
- Same rubric for all research orgs

**Yaqeen Institute:**
- Focus on Islamic theological research
- Score based on research rigor and uptake
- Different audience (Muslim community vs. policymakers)
