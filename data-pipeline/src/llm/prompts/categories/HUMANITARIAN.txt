## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR HUMANITARIAN ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)
- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): International treaty influence, paradigm-shifting models adopted by others (e.g., Partners in Health's model replicated by WHO), creates infrastructure others depend on
- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Operating at scale ($100M+), influencing national policies, building local healthcare/education systems
- 12-19 (REGIONAL): Multi-country operations with documented replication, training local capacity
- 6-11 (LOCAL): Direct service delivery, limited capacity building
- 0-5 (CONSUMPTIVE): One-time distributions only (qurbani, Ramadan baskets, seasonal aid)

### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components

**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared tomorrow, how hard to replace?
- 7-8: Built unique infrastructure (MSF's conflict zone expertise, UNHCR's resettlement network)
- 5-6: Few alternatives in specific region or approach
- 3-4: Other orgs doing similar work (most humanitarian orgs)
- 1-2: Many organizations do same thing (generic food distribution)

**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?
- 5-6: Serving Muslim-majority populations (Gaza, Syria, Yemen, Rohingya)
- 3-4: Mixed populations including significant Muslim communities
- 1-2: General humanitarian work with minimal Muslim focus

**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?
- 5-6: Forgotten crises (not headline disasters), chronically underfunded emergencies
- 3-4: Secondary crises with moderate funding
- 1-2: Major headline crises (Gaza, Syria) with significant donor attention
- 0: Peak seasonal campaigns (Ramadan, Qurbani)

### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components

**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability
- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, independent audit, all policies in place
- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, strong controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: CN Accountability 50-69, significant governance gaps
- 0-3: Missing audits, poor accountability

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: International multi-country=3, National=2, Regional=1, Local=0
- Zakat: Active zakat channel + growing=3, Has zakat=2, Could accept=1, Can't absorb=0

### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components

**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they do?
- 7-8: Real-time dashboards, granular tracking (MSF, Direct Relief)
- 5-6: Annual reports with detailed metrics (meals, beneficiaries)
- 3-4: Basic counts, some inconsistency
- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions only
- 0: No metrics

**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Do they measure what CHANGED?
- 9-10: Lives saved calculations, health outcomes linked to intervention
- 7-8: Clear outcome metrics (child survival rates, recovery rates)
- 5-6: Some outcome indicators beyond outputs
- 3-4: Outputs only ("meals served" without health outcomes)
- 0-2: No outcome measurement

**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?
- 6-7: Independent evaluations, RCTs, public dashboards
- 4-5: Third-party audits, external quality reviews
- 2-3: Standard financial audit only
- 0-1: Limited or no external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION
A Muslim humanitarian org scoring 26-30 on Systemic Leverage should demonstrate:
- Paradigm-shifting innovation (not just "we help people")
- Programs adopted/replicated by other organizations
- Measurable structural change in recipient communities
- Scale and efficiency comparable to MSF or WFP

Most Muslim humanitarian orgs should score 12-22 on Systemic Leverage unless they demonstrate exceptional systemic impact.
