## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)
- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Education models replicated nationally/globally, government adoption of methodologies, paradigm shift (e.g., BRAC's non-formal primary education adopted by governments)
- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Thousands of schools, training government teachers, influencing national curriculum
- 12-19 (REGIONAL): Multi-region operations, documented quality outcomes, capacity building
- 6-11 (LOCAL): Individual schools, limited scale
- 0-5 (MINIMAL): Scholarship-only programs without institutional impact

- 5-6: Few alternatives in specific region (TCF in Pakistani slums)
- 3-4: Some other orgs doing education in similar regions
- 1-2: Many scholarship/education programs available

**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?

- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure
- 0-3: Weak accountability

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: Multi-country=3, National=2, Regional=1, Local=0
- Zakat: Education for poor can qualify (1-3 typical depending on beneficiaries)

### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components

**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they do?

- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions
- 0: No metrics

**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Do they measure learning outcomes?

- 7-8: Graduation rates, exam pass rates, employment outcomes (TCF's 99% matriculation)
- 5-6: Some outcome indicators (attendance, completion)
- 3-4: Enrollment only, no learning measurement
- 0-2: No outcome tracking

**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?
- 6-7: Independent learning assessments, RCTs, government recognition
- 4-5: Third-party school quality audits
- 2-3: Standard financial audit only
- 0-1: Limited external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**TCF (The Citizens Foundation) calibration:**
- 2,000+ schools is significant scale (score 20-25 on Systemic Leverage)
- But not yet at BRAC level (paradigm shift, government adoption)
- Appropriate range: 82-88 total score (not 92)

**BRAC sets the standard:**
- $1 billion organization
- Education model adopted by multiple governments
- Pioneered microfinance and non-formal education
- Most education orgs should score below BRAC tier
