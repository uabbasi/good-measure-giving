## CRITICAL CALIBRATION

**Green Muslims example:**
- Unique position reaching Muslim community on environmental issues = higher Ummah Gap (11-15)
- Smaller scale = lower Systemic Leverage (6-11)
- Appropriate range: 55-70 total score

**Sierra Club/NRDC are the standards for systemic environmental impact.**
