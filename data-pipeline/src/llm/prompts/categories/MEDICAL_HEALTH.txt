## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR MEDICAL/HEALTH ORGS

### Systemic Leverage (0-30)
- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Treatment protocols adopted globally, medical breakthroughs, training programs that produce physicians at scale (e.g., Partners in Health training 1000s of community health workers)
- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Building permanent health infrastructure, establishing sustainable clinics, training local healthcare workers
- 12-19 (REGIONAL): Multiple permanent clinics, ongoing treatment programs, some capacity building
- 6-11 (LOCAL): Single clinic operation, direct patient care without systemic change
- 0-5 (CONSUMPTIVE): Medical missions only, no ongoing presence

### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components

**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?
- 7-8: Built unique medical infrastructure (PCRF's only pediatric cancer dept in West Bank)
- 5-6: Few alternatives for this specialty in region (SAMS in Syria)
- 3-4: Other orgs providing similar medical services
- 1-2: Many organizations doing similar work (standard medical missions)

**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?
- 5-6: Muslim-majority regions (Gaza, Syria, Yemen) or Muslim-specific health gaps (mental health stigma)
- 3-4: Health services reaching Muslim populations among others
- 1-2: General health services with limited Muslim-specific focus

**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?
- 5-6: Mental health (huge stigma), disability services, health research
- 3-4: General healthcare with moderate funding
- 1-2: Crisis medical response in headline emergencies (Gaza, Syria)

### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components

**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability
- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, medical licensing compliance, strong governance
- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls
- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps
- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure
- 0-3: Weak accountability

**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)
- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0
- Geographic: Multi-country operations=3, National/multi-region=2, Regional=1, Local=0
- Zakat: Medical care for poor can qualify (2-3 typical)

### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components

**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they do?
- 7-8: Real-time patient tracking, procedures dashboard, medication distribution
- 5-6: Annual reports with patients served, procedures performed
- 3-4: Basic patient counts
- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions
- 0: No metrics

**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Clinical outcomes measured?
- 9-10: Mortality reduction, treatment success rates, longitudinal health tracking
- 7-8: Patient outcomes measured (SAMS clinical outcomes, Action Against Hunger GAM rate)
- 5-6: Some outcome indicators (treatment completion, recovery)
- 3-4: Procedures only, no outcome measurement
- 0-2: No outcome tracking

**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?
- 6-7: Peer-reviewed research, independent clinical evaluations, accreditation
- 4-5: Third-party audits, external quality reviews
- 2-3: Standard financial audit only
- 0-1: Limited external review

## CRITICAL CALIBRATION
Mental health organizations (Khalil Center, Maristan) may score higher on Ummah Gap (16-20) because mental health is severely underserved in Muslim communities - this is genuine infrastructure work.

Crisis medical orgs (SAMS, PCRF) often score 12-19 on Systemic Leverage unless they are building permanent healthcare infrastructure.
