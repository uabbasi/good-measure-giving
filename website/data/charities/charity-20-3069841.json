The process involves discussions with National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) and other organizations to establish net need and accountability. AMF partners with in-country organizations for distribution and ensures rigorous monitoring and evaluation, including pre-distribution surveys, independent supervision during distribution, and post-distribution check-ups (PDCUs) to assess net usage and condition over time. AMF's approach is guided by principles of efficiency, transparency, and demonstrating impact, with a clear focus on measurable outcomes such as nets distributed, people protected, lives saved, and malaria cases averted.",
