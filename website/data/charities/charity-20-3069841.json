In the 2024 tax year, the organization reported <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $62,286,888</cite>, all of which was derived from contributions. AMF operates with extreme financial leaness, achieving a <cite id=\"5\">fundraising efficiency of $0.00 spent to raise every $1</cite>. Beyond procurement, the organization is distinguished by its <cite id=\"6\">rigorous post-distribution check-ups</cite> (PDCUs), which use smartphone technology to track <cite id=\"7\">net usage and hanging status</cite> at 6, 12, 18, and 24-month intervals. These monitoring efforts ensure that the <cite id=\"8\">624,532 nets distributed in specific campaigns</cite> are actually providing the intended protection. By partnering with local health authorities in countries like <cite id=\"9\">Guinea, Malawi, and South Sudan</cite>, AMF integrates its distributions into national malaria control strategies while maintaining independent oversight of impact data.",
