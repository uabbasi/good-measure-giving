This framework details their approach to funding and distributing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to reduce malaria. Key elements include identifying high-risk malaria areas with a need for nets, partnering with reliable distribution organizations, and adhering to four operational principles: accurate household-level net need data, independent supervision during distribution, post-distribution monitoring of net use and condition, and tracking monthly malaria case rate data. AMF's guiding principles are impact, accountability, transparency, and efficiency, ensuring that 100% of public donations are used to purchase nets. They also emphasize rigorous monitoring and evaluation to track net usage and impact, and report on these activities transparently.",
