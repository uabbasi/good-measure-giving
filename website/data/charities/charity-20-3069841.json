The process involves discussions with National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) and other organizations to establish net need and accountability. AMF partners with in-country organizations for distribution and ensures rigorous monitoring and evaluation, including pre-distribution surveys, independent supervision during distribution, and post-distribution check-ups (PDCUs) to assess net usage and condition over time. AMF's approach is guided by principles of efficiency, transparency, and demonstrating impact, with a clear focus on measurable outcomes such as nets distributed, people protected, lives saved, and malaria cases averted.",

      "summary": "The Against Malaria Foundation (US) is a highly specialized humanitarian organization dedicated to the procurement and distribution of <cite id=\"1\">long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)</cite> to combat malaria globally. Founded in <cite id=\"2\">2003</cite>, the organization has established itself as a leader in cost-effective health interventions, operating extensively across <cite id=\"3\">Africa, Asia, and South America</cite>. In the 2024 fiscal year, the foundation reported <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $62,286,888</cite>, all of which was derived from contributions. What distinguishes the foundation is its <cite id=\"5\">100.0% program expense ratio</cite>, ensuring that every dollar of public donation is used directly for the purchase of nets. This efficiency is supported by a <cite id=\"6\">fundraising efficiency of $0.00 per $1 raised</cite>, as private donors often cover the organization's minimal overhead costs. The foundation employs a data-driven approach, utilizing <cite id=\"7\">post-distribution check-ups (PDCUs)</cite> to monitor net usage and condition. For example, technical reports from their monitoring activities track specific metrics such as <cite id=\"8\">net hanging status and the physical state of repair</cite> to ensure long-term efficacy. Despite its high financial efficiency, the organization maintains a <cite id=\"9\">small board of four members</cite>, which impacts its governance score, though it holds a <cite id=\"10\">Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid</cite>.",
