The approach emphasizes a need-based method to identify immediate needs of children and focuses on their long-term care and education. The organization's mission is to build and sustain loving homes and provide high-quality education, aiming to recreate a family environment and foster a strong sense of identity and self-esteem for the children under their care. Furthermore, Charity Navigator indicates that Givelight Foundation demonstrates strategic thinking through its articulated mission and implements 'Evaluation and Learning Programs' to track progress towards its outcomes.
