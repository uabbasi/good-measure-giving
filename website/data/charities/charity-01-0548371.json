This document details their approach to turning charitable donations into legal services for cases with potential civil liberties impact, often referred to as impact litigation. Their mission is to advance equality and justice for American Muslim organizations and individuals by combating injustices in the name of national security. Key actions include funding the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America (CLCMA) for civil rights litigation to set precedents beneficial to the American Muslim community. Additionally, their Annual Reports (e.g., 2022 and 2024) further elaborate on strategic priorities such as strengthening and protecting the Muslim nonprofit community, preventing unwarranted indictments, and increasing the reach of impact litigation. MLFA also launched 'The Ihsan Standard Project' in partnership with the Muslim Philanthropy Initiative, which focuses on governance, risk, and compliance for Muslim nonprofits.",
