The approach emphasizes empowerment and sustainability, aiming to eradicate poverty by providing grants for education, vocational training, or the acquisition of tools and assets to enable self-sufficient livelihoods. The Foundation is committed to maximizing the impact of donations through operational efficiency and transparency.
