      "summary": "founded in 2014, the Sachse Muslim Society (SMS) serves as a vital religious and educational hub for the Muslim community in <cite id=\"1\">Sachse, Wylie, Rowlett, and North Garland</cite>. The organization primarily operates the Sachse Quran Academy, which offers specialized curricula including <cite id=\"2\">Full Time Hifdh and Part Time Hifz programs</cite> focused on Quranic memorization. In the 2023 fiscal year, the society reported <cite id=\"3\">total revenue of $2,799,757</cite>, marking a period of significant financial growth. While the organization maintains a <cite id=\"4\">strong working capital of 63.0 months</cite>, its current operational model allocates <cite id=\"5\">13.6% of expenses to programs</cite>, a figure that is notably lower than the <cite id=\"6\">89.8% peer program ratio median</cite> for humanitarian and religious organizations. Despite this, the society demonstrates high fiscal discipline in its development efforts, maintaining a <cite id=\"7\">fundraising efficiency of $0.11 per $1 raised</cite>. As a <cite id=\"8\">zakat-eligible institution</cite>, SMS provides a local avenue for donors to fulfill their religious obligations through support of <cite id=\"9\">fi sabilillah (in the way of Allah)</cite> initiatives, specifically targeting religious education and community infrastructure in the North Texas region.",
