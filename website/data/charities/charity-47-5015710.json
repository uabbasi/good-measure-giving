  "theoryOfChange": "The Chicago Community Bond Fund (CCBF) explicitly refers to having a 'theory of change' that guides their work. A representative stated, 'Because of our theory of change, our commitment to movement work, and our belief that grassroots organizing is what achieves social change, there was an agreement early on to have an expansive role, but also to prioritize those sorts of political arrests, to prioritize support for grassroots social movement.' This theory emphasizes providing resources to lessen the state's power to repress social movements. \n\nTheir strategic framework is further described through their mission and activities: CCBF operates a revolving fund to pay bonds for individuals in Cook County, Illinois, who cannot afford them, particularly those affected by structural violence. They believe that the inability to pay bond leads to higher conviction rates, longer sentences, loss of housing and jobs, family separation, and loss of child custody. By posting bond, CCBF aims to restore the presumption of innocence before trial and allow individuals to remain free while fighting their cases. Additionally, CCBF engages in public education about the role of bond in the criminal legal system and advocates for the complete abolition of money bond. They are committed to long-term relationship building and organizing with those most impacted by criminalization and policing.",
