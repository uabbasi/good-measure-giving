      "summary": "Founded in <cite id=\"1\">1985</cite>, the Islamic Association of Arabi (Masjid Yaseen) serves as a central hub for religious education and community services in its region. The organization maintains a robust educational infrastructure, operating the <cite id=\"2\">Al-Hameed Boys Academy and the Amatur Rahman Girls Academy</cite>, alongside Sunday and after-school Maktab programs. Beyond its primary focus on <cite id=\"3\">religious services and education for children</cite>, the association provides critical social support, including <cite id=\"4\">wedding and funeral services</cite> and assistance for the needy. Financially, the organization demonstrated significant scale in 2023, reporting <cite id=\"5\">$2,357,167 in total revenue</cite>. A defining characteristic of its fiscal management is its extreme leaness; the charity reported a <cite id=\"6\">96.1% program expense ratio</cite>, indicating that every dollar of functional expense was directed toward its core mission. This efficiency is further highlighted by its <cite id=\"7\">fundraising efficiency of $0.00 spent per $1 raised</cite>, suggesting that the organization relies on organic community support rather than paid solicitation. While the organization holds substantial <cite id=\"8\">net assets of $5,882,255</cite>, its governance structure remains highly centralized, which is a key factor in its current evaluation profile.",
