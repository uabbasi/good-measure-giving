      "summary": "The Islamic Association of Arabi, established in <cite id=\"1\">1985</cite>, serves as a central religious and educational hub for the Muslim community in Arabi, Louisiana. The organization operates a comprehensive suite of educational programs, most notably the <cite id=\"2\">Al-Hameed Boys Academy and the Amatur Rahman Girls Academy</cite>, which provide structured religious instruction for children. Beyond its core academic mission, the association facilitates essential community services including <cite id=\"3\">wedding and funeral rites</cite>, as well as dawah initiatives and social support for those in need. Financially, the organization demonstrates a significant scale for a regional center, reporting <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $2,357,167</cite> in the 2023 tax year. A defining characteristic of its financial model is its extreme leaness; the association maintains a <cite id=\"5\">program expense ratio of 96.1%</cite> according to recent filings, ensuring that nearly every dollar contributed is directed toward its service delivery and educational mandates. This efficiency is further highlighted by a <cite id=\"6\">fundraising efficiency of $0.00 per $1 raised</cite>, indicating that the organization does not utilize professional solicitors or expensive campaigns to secure its funding, relying instead on community-driven support and program service revenue.",
