  "theoryOfChange": "The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) has a published 'Strategic Plan 2023-2027', referred to as a 'five-year strategic framework'. This framework outlines bold new investments in science and scientists, increased teamwork across programs, campaigns, and partnerships, and a conviction that a better future is possible. The plan reinforces UCS's commitment to science by dedicating an organization-wide goal to building the influence of science and scientists through an elevated Science Network and new investments in innovation. It details ambitious goals and five-year outcomes that serve as stepping-stones, building upon successful programs with new approaches and strategies to address urgent demands. The plan also emphasizes the importance of strong partnerships and effective collaboration with other organizations. Key strategies include promoting science in public decision-making, building leadership in states and regional coalitions for clean energy, transportation, climate policy, and sustainable food and agriculture systems. The framework aims to advance science-based solutions to urgent problems such as climate change emissions, transportation systems, food, nuclear weapons, and decision-making and elections.",
