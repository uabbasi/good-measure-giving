      "summary": "The Islamic Society of Northwest Suburbs of Chicago (ISNS) is a long-standing religious institution that has served the Muslim community in the Chicago metropolitan area since its <cite id=\"1\">founding in 1974</cite>. The organization operates as a comprehensive community hub, providing <cite id=\"2\">daily and Friday congregations</cite>, funeral services, and marriage ceremonies. Beyond its role as a house of worship, ISNS manages significant educational initiatives, including the <cite id=\"3\">Little Scholar Early Childhood Program</cite> and the Al Ihsan Academy Sunday School. Financially, the organization demonstrates substantial scale for a regional religious center, reporting <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $4,092,615</cite> in the 2023 tax year. A defining characteristic of its financial model is its extreme leaness; the organization maintains a <cite id=\"5\">program expense ratio of 92.5%</cite> according to recent filings, ensuring that nearly every dollar contributed is directed toward its core religious and educational missions. This efficiency is further highlighted by its fundraising operations, which cost only <cite id=\"6\">$0.01 to raise every $1</cite>. As a <cite id=\"7\">zakat-eligible organization</cite>, ISNS provides a vital channel for local donors to fulfill their religious obligations, specifically serving categories such as the <cite id=\"8\">poor (fuqara) and needy (masakin)</cite> through its dedicated zakat services.",
