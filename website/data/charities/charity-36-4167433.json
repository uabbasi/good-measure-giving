IMAN's vision is to be a model for facilitating transformational change in urban communities, inspiring civic engagement and social justice. This comprehensive approach, detailed across their 'About' section, including 'Strategic Initiatives' and 'Principles of Change' on their website, serves as a documented program strategy explaining how their activities lead to impact.",
