For example, under 'Leadership Development,' MAS aims to 'Empower a new generation of leaders' through activities like training, equipping, and supporting, with expected outcomes of increased 'Capacity' and 'Influence.' This structured approach, linking activities to desired outcomes, functions as an impact framework or logic model, explaining how their programs are intended to create impact.",
