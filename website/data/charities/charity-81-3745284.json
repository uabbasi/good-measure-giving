Financially, the organization demonstrated significant growth in the 2023 tax year, reporting <cite id=\"5\">total revenue of $832,882</cite>. A defining characteristic of MAS LA's operations is its extreme leaness; the organization reported a <cite id=\"6\">program expense ratio of 77.3%</cite> in its most recent filings, suggesting that nearly all contributions are directed toward service delivery.
