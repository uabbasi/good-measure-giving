This strategic plan outlines their mission to save, improve, and protect lives by eliminating hunger through prevention, detection, and treatment of undernutrition. It details their approach to tackling the immediate, underlying, and root causes of undernutrition through a multisectoral approach, working with local communities and integrating into national systems for long-term solutions. The plan also highlights key priorities such as saving lives in emergencies, building resilience, transforming systems to prevent hunger, and mitigating the effects of key drivers of hunger like climate change and gender inequality. It sets ambitions to empower 25 million people to overcome hunger by 2025 and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly ending hunger by 2030.",
