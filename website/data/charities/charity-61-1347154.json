These priorities include strengthening their high school college preparatory program, investing in staff, enhancing student support systems, improving internal systems, and expanding their STEM program. The school's mission is to provide a holistic education that fosters the balanced development of students spiritually, morally, intellectually, emotionally, and physically, aiming to cultivate lifelong learners with strong character. A key component of their approach is the school-wide implementation of the Ci3T (Comprehensive, Integrated, Three-Tiered) model, which integrates the Positive Action social-emotional learning program and PBIS. This Ci3T framework supports academics, behavior, and social-emotional learning, utilizing data triangulation from attendance, grades, referrals, and screening data in Ci3T Leadership Team meetings to systematically identify and provide timely support to students.",
