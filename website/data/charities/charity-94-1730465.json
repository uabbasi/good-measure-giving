It emphasizes that every staff member has the power and responsibility to advance justice in their interactions, choices, and work. Their approach involves critical inquiry to understand their impact internally and externally. Additionally, Earthjustice's 'Our Work' section details their goals, such as ending fossil fuel extraction, securing clean air and water, and building a justice-centered environmental movement, and describes their key strategies to achieve these, including using legal tools and partnering with communities.",
