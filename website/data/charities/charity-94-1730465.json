This framework guides their work and vision, emphasizing justice, partnership, inclusion, and excellence as core values. They also explicitly state a 'theory of change' in the context of their efforts to transition away from coal-fired power plants, where forcing environmental compliance makes coal economically uncompetitive with clean energy sources. Furthermore, Earthjustice's 'Our Work' section refers to a 'Strategic Plan' and outlines their goals, which include ending fossil fuel extraction, powering with 100% clean energy, securing clean air and water for all, building a justice-centered environmental movement, removing toxic chemicals, farming sustainably, safeguarding lands and waters, and protecting biodiversity.",
