The theory posits that access to quality education for girls in northern Pakistan will break the intergenerational cycle of poverty, lead to community development, and strengthen the region's overall health. Their strategic priorities to achieve this include Community Engagement, Teacher Training & Development, Learning Environments, Student Success, and Access to Higher Education and Career Pathways. They engage community leaders and mothers, hire and train teachers, construct K-12 classrooms, provide school supplies, create positive learning environments, support students with learning differences, and provide scholarships for college and vocational degrees.",
