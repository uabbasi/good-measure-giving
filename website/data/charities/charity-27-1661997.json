Their approach involves identifying eligible households, transferring cash directly, and then studying the resulting impacts on various outcomes. These outcomes include increased asset holdings, consumption, food security, psychological well-being, and earnings for recipients, as well as positive spillover effects on non-recipients within the community. GiveDirectly's model suggests that cash transfers lead to measurable improvements in well-being and economic activity. Their 'Our Research' page serves as a central repository for studies and evaluations that detail how their programs create impact.",
