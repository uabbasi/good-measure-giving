This approach enables recipients to make their own consumption and investment decisions, thereby most effectively improving their individual and household well-being. [23, 34] The organization identifies beneficiaries using objective criteria, such as housing material, which correlates with poverty levels. [8] They utilize secure and transparent electronic payment services, primarily mobile phones, to deliver the cash transfers. [8] GiveDirectly is committed to rigorously measuring the impact of its programs, often partnering with organizations like Innovations for Poverty Action to conduct randomized evaluations. [8, 9, 39] These evaluations aim to understand the longer-run impacts, cost-effectiveness, and influence on the larger economy. [8] The core idea is to identify households in severe poverty and transfer cash to them with no conditions, measuring short and long-term outcomes through independent research. [9]",
