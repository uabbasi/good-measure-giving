Its long-term goal is to contribute to the knowledge of human civilizations and envision a future of prosperity, justice, and peace. This is accomplished by conducting evidence-based/empirical research and generating new knowledge on universal Qur'anic values and their influence on human development and consciousness in Muslim societies. The results are intended for use by researchers, policymakers, and education change agents. The project's methodology includes a thorough selection process for study methods, design, and a conceptual framework, ensuring sensitivity to local conditions and the use of reliable and valid international instruments.",
