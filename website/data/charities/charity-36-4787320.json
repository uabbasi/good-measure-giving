The charity works inside prisons to provide legal education, training, and practice within prison communities, enabling people in prison and prison staff to study law, qualify as paralegals and lawyers, and defend themselves and their peers. Their approach involves education (training paralegals, strengthening legal knowledge, delivering accredited law degrees), practice (advising clients, preparing cases, pursuing public interest litigation), and convening (bringing together allies for shared reflection and service). This work is intended to help individuals within the criminal justice system flourish and promote more equitable, just, and peaceful societies, aligning with the UN's 2030 SDG 16.",
