This framework was developed through workshops and facilitated sessions to articulate how their activities lead to impact, focusing on the core outcome of the right to fair hearings for the defenceless. Their approach involves working inside prisons to provide legal education, training, and practice, enabling people in prison and prison staff to study law, qualify as paralegals and lawyers, and defend themselves and their peers in court. The most important outcome in their model is that defenceless individuals in conflict with the law receive a fair hearing, which then creates a ripple effect of greater impact on families, prisons, court systems, communities, and societies.",
