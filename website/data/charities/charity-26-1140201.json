The 'About Us' page describes their overarching approach of uniting people across divides to achieve an America with 'fewer people behind bars, less pollution, and more opportunity' through their Green, Justice, and Tech programs. Their 2024 Impact Report further elaborates on their strategy, including specific goals related to the Inflation Reduction Act, such as ensuring 40% of climate investments go to disadvantaged communities and 15% of climate contracts are awarded to minority-owned businesses. The report also highlights outcomes like upskilling Black and LatinX talent in climate and tech careers and removing barriers for underserved entrepreneurs. The 'Transformative Communities' section details their approach to partnering with local stakeholders to help community-based organizations and entrepreneurs access federal and private funding for climate projects in 25 disadvantaged communities. The Justice program's approach involves building consensus for criminal justice reform among Republicans and Democrats, leading to legislative changes and training for justice-impacted leaders. This collective documentation serves as an impact framework, describing their programs, intended changes, and measurable results.",
