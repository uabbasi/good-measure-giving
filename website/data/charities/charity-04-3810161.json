These reports serve as a framework for understanding how their activities lead to impact. For example, the 2024 Impact Report highlights that ICNA Relief served over 1,043,149 individuals across 120 nationalities in 42 states, detailing their mission to help Americans in need through various programs like disaster relief, shelters, hunger prevention, mentorship, and healthcare services. The organization strives to uplift the underserved, build healthy communities, strengthen families, and create opportunities while maintaining dignity. Their Muslim Family Services program, for instance, utilizes a 'holistic framework' in its services. Programs like the Refugee Program aim to empower individuals through housing, job training, and financial literacy, fostering self-sufficiency. The Back2School Program, which distributed over 1 million backpacks by 2024, focuses on restoring dignity, empowering education, and uniting communities by providing essential tools to break the cycle of poverty. These reports and descriptions collectively demonstrate a documented approach to measuring and tracking their impact.",
