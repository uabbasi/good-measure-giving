Operating primarily in the United States and Canada, the organization addresses sensitive topics through a faith-informed lens, providing <cite id=\"3\">health education, advocacy, and survivor care</cite>. In the 2023 fiscal year, HEART reported <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $1,089,496</cite>, largely driven by <cite id=\"5\">contributions totaling $1,041,599</cite>. The organization maintains a <cite id=\"6\">Silver Seal of Transparency from Candid</cite>, reflecting a commitment to public disclosure. While the organization is relatively small, it fills a critical gap in the Muslim nonprofit sector by tackling issues of sexual health and violence that are often underserved. HEART is <cite id=\"7\">zakat-eligible</cite>, maintaining a policy that directs funds toward specific categories of need, including <cite id=\"8\">the poor (fuqara) and needy (masakin)</cite>. Financially, the charity demonstrates significant stability, holding <cite id=\"9\">25.6 months of working capital</cite> in working capital, which ensures long-term viability but suggests a high capacity for additional program deployment.",
