Charity Navigator reports that UMR revisits how program activities lead to change and tracks program progress by monitoring both activities and outcomes. The organization researches its program model before implementation by reviewing academic research, consulting other nonprofits, referring to practices of similar nonprofits and government programs, surveying target populations, and assessing ethical and legal compliance. Furthermore, a job description for a Sudan Program Coordinator on UMR's website explicitly states the responsibility to 'Develop and implement robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track program performance and impact.' This indicates a documented approach to understanding and measuring the effectiveness of their interventions.",
