Their mission is 'To help underserved and marginalized communities build their capacity toward resilience,' and their vision is 'To become the organization of choice for improving lives worldwide.' UMR's approach emphasizes 'Robust project design, Innovative community solutions, [and] Respect the dignity of the beneficiaries.' They prioritize both relief and development, aiming for long-term solutions that empower communities for sustainable recovery. The organization tracks program progress by monitoring activities and outcomes, and Charity Navigator confirms that UMR revisits how program activities lead to change and researches program models before implementation. The UMR Institute also serves as a 'think tank' providing research and evidence-based reasons for UMR's activities and studying the impact of their projects. Their annual reports, available on their website, detail their programs, beneficiaries served, and the outcomes achieved across various sectors like health, water, food security, and education, demonstrating a structured approach to measuring and tracking their impact.",
