This strategic framework focuses on advancing racial justice in the Deep South and beyond, with clear goals across four programmatic areas: promoting democracy and civic engagement, eliminating poverty, decarcerating and decriminalizing Black and Brown communities, and relegating white supremacy out of the mainstream. The SPLC's strategic framework also incorporates innovation as a core approach to propel systemic change. Their work is further detailed in documents like the 'Advancing the SPLC's New Strategic Direction', 'Areas of Impact', and their annual 'Impact Reports', which describe their long-term impact goals and how they measure their contribution to these goals.",
