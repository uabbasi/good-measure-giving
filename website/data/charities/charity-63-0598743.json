This is evident in their 'Request for Proposals for Indicators for Use of SPLC Resources' document. This document explicitly states the SPLC's role in overturning barriers and effecting change, identifying five areas of work to achieve its mission. It details an organizational goal to 'Increase power and capacity for multi-racial, inclusive democracy in the South,' and four programmatic impact goals: to strengthen democracy, relegate white supremacy, reduce the incarcerated and detained population, and eradicate poverty. The SPLC has also selected eight impact goal indicators to measure its progress against these long-term goals. Further evidence of their strategic approach is found in their '2022 Impact Report', '2026 Policy Priorities for Alabama', and 'A policy platform to meet the challenges of 2024 and beyond', which consistently articulate their focus areas and objectives, such as strengthening democracy, combating hate and extremism, and eradicating poverty.",
