      "summary": "Founded in <cite id=\"1\">2005</cite>, Ta'leef Collective serves as a specialized community hub focused on providing a healthy understanding and realization of Islam for converts and those seeking spiritual growth. Operating primarily in the <cite id=\"2\">Chicago Metropolitan Area</cite>, the organization offers a unique educational framework through programs like <cite id=\"3\">Convert Care and the Inheritors</cite> initiative. While the charity maintains a strong niche in the American Muslim landscape, its financial profile presents a complex picture for donors. In 2023, the organization reported <cite id=\"4\">$171,667 in executive compensation</cite> for its CEO, while maintaining a <cite id=\"5\">fundraising efficiency of $0.01 per $1 raised</cite>, indicating highly lean donor acquisition costs. However, the organization's <cite id=\"6\">program expense ratio is recorded at 22.1%</cite>, which is significantly below the <cite id=\"7\">peer program ratio median of 78.4%</cite> for global education charities. Despite these financial efficiency concerns, Ta'leef remains a vital resource for community companionship, facilitating <cite id=\"8\">101 shahadas</cite> and serving as the first community contact for <cite id=\"9\">395 new Muslims</cite> according to their 2023 annual report. The organization also manages a dedicated <cite id=\"10\">Zakat Fund</cite> that distributed <cite id=\"11\">$140,000 in assistance</cite> to eligible recipients.",
