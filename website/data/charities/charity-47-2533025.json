  "mission": "Muslim Wellness Foundation (MWF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting healing and well-being in American Muslim communities through dialogue, education and training. The MWF approach to health is interdisciplinary, intergenerational, spiritually grounded, community based, and justice-oriented. From being the first Muslim organization in the country to offer Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) trainings to establishing the annual Black Muslim Psychology Conference (BMPC), MWF has been an outspoken leader in fostering visions for wellness and healing. Our programs demonstrate our keen awareness of the link between oppression, wellness and how communities heal, grow, thrive, and experience joy in the midst of it all. We will continue to lead the way in shifting the conversation on mental health, addiction and trauma - from one narrowly focused on stigma to a healing-centered model of collective well-being, faith, identity and belonging. Join us on this journey.",
