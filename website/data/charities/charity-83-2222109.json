The organization's mission is to provide relief and solutions through 'evidence-based, culturally competent community empowerment'. Their approach outlines a causal chain from global investment to local employment, business expansion, and economic multiplication, leading to sustainable development outcomes and long-term economic transformation. They detail how women's economic participation is increased by redirecting time from water collection to income-generating activities, fostering household income and community economic activity. Furthermore, Paani emphasizes skills transfer and business creation for construction workers, alongside vendor ecosystem development. The organization also commits to upholding UN Sustainability Goals (SDG 3, 4, 6) and employs a 'standard approach' for its Wells Relief program, which includes assessing community needs, building infrastructure, and providing maintenance training. Transparency is a key aspect, with donors receiving documentation of well construction and community benefits.",
