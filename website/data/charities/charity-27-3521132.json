This framework emphasizes quick action, leveraging local resources, and adapting in real time to provide meals during humanitarian, climate, and community crises. WCK's approach focuses on being 'first to the frontlines' and has developed a model for disaster relief that helps communities recover and establish resilient food systems. Their strategy involves activating a small core team, connecting with local community members, and serving as trainers and capacity builders. Beyond immediate relief, WCK's Resilience Programs aim to strengthen food security by training chefs and school cooks, promoting clean cooking practices, and supporting local farms, fisheries, and small businesses. They also prioritize community empowerment by involving local chefs, volunteers, and stakeholders in meal preparation and distribution.",

This efficiency is supported by a lean fundraising strategy that costs only <cite id=\"5\">$0.05 to raise every $1</cite>.
