Their model emphasizes quick action, leveraging local resources, and adapting in real time to serve nourishing meals. WCK's mission is guided by the belief that food is a universal human right. They prioritize partnering with local organizations, restaurants, and food trucks, and purchasing local ingredients to support regional economies. Beyond immediate disaster relief, WCK also engages in 'Resilience Programs' that aim to strengthen sustenance security by training chefs and school cooks, advancing clean cooking practices, and providing grants to farms, fisheries, and small businesses to promote educational and professional opportunities. This comprehensive approach details how their activities lead to both immediate relief and longer-term community impact.",

The organization operates with a high degree of financial efficiency, reporting <cite id=\"2\">$241,549,612 in total revenue</cite> for the 2023 tax year. WCK is distinguished by its operational model of <cite id=\"3\">direct provision of fresh meals</cite> rather than shelf-stable rations, deploying to frontlines in regions including <cite id=\"4\">Gaza, Ukraine, and the United States</cite>. Financial data indicates that the charity maintains a <cite id=\"5\">92.5% program expense ratio</cite>, ensuring that the vast majority of donor contributions are utilized for frontline services. Furthermore, the organization demonstrates <cite id=\"6\">exceptional fundraising efficiency</cite>, spending only <cite id=\"7\">$0.05 to raise every $1</cite> in charitable support. This lean administrative structure allows for <cite id=\"8\">rapid deployment of resources</cite> when natural disasters or conflicts occur. WCK also maintains significant liquidity, with <cite id=\"9\">6.9 months of working capital</cite> available to sustain operations during sudden-onset emergencies. While the organization is not a traditional faith-based charity, its work in <cite id=\"10\">underserved regions like Gaza and Lebanon</cite> aligns with the humanitarian values of many Muslim donors seeking to provide immediate relief to communities in distress.",
