These documents detail their data-driven approach to voter mobilization and civic engagement, outlining how their activities lead to intended impact. For instance, the 2020 Impact Report for the Million Muslim Votes campaign explicitly shares the strategies used and the resulting impact, including voter turnout numbers and organizing efforts. Emgage's approach involves targeted canvassing, personalized texting, phone banking, and strategic ad campaigns to educate and motivate voters, as well as programs like the Emerging Leaders Program to train future leaders. They emphasize a data-driven methodology to identify areas where engagement can yield effective impact and are dedicated to bridging the gap between the electorate and policies that affect their lives through grassroots efforts.",
