The IRC systematically uses theories of change in all its new project designs to ensure outcome-driven and evidence-based projects. The OEF also includes core indicators to measure the change in outcomes over time. Additionally, the IRC utilizes an 'IMPACT Program Quality Framework' which defines program quality through six principles and supports the goals of their broader 'Strategy100'.",
