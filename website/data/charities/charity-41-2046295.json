Their Education Program outlines a structured approach to ensuring quality education, involving a dedicated QA team that conducts school visits, formal classroom observations, stakeholder engagement, and the development of school improvement plans. This includes measuring and analyzing results, sharing findings, and identifying areas for future strategy and action. The organization also mentions 'TCF's Strategy 2030' as a key strategic development. Furthermore, TCF's annual reports and impact statements, such as those from TCF Canada, explicitly detail the impact of their projects, linking activities to outcomes like providing foundational education and preventing child labor. They also highlight their strategy in increasing and retaining girls' enrollment. This comprehensive approach to planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation serves as a robust impact framework.",
