They describe their work as tackling flaws within the criminal legal system to eliminate wrongful convictions and disproportionately harm communities of color. Their approach involves strategic litigation, policy reform, and education. Key initiatives include improving access to post-conviction courts, strengthening police and prosecutorial accountability, compensating wrongly convicted individuals, and reforming practices that lead to misidentifications, unreliable informant testimony, coerced guilty pleas, and false confessions. The organization's three main goals are to represent possible exonerees in court, provide assistance for exonerees upon release, and work towards policy reforms to reduce wrongful convictions. They also refer to a 'justice reform strategy' in the context of ensuring meaningful compensation for exonerees.",
