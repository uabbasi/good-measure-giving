The Annual Operational Report 2023 further details progress against the objectives set out in this Strategic Plan and explicitly includes results frameworks and key statistics. Additionally, UNRWA has a \"Protection Strategic Framework\" that clarifies how the agency delivers its protection mandate, defining protection pillars and outcome areas. The \"UNRWA Digital Transformation Strategy (2022 \u2013 2026)\" is also a significant component of the Strategic Plan, providing a framework with high-level objectives, initiatives, and performance indicators.",
