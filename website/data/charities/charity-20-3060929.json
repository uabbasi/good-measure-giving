It outlines their process of becoming a trauma-informed agency, which included learning about types of trauma and trauma-informed care, assessing existing culturally-sensitive practices, identifying new practices, training staff, and collaborating with researchers to document and build a body of evidence-based practice, all while maintaining a survivor-centered approach. The report articulates a model that integrates culturally-sensitive services and trauma-informed advocacy, which TMWF invites others to learn from and replicate.",
