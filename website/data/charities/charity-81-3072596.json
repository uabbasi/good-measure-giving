Their approach is rooted in delivering innovative educational solutions through public-private partnerships, direct engagement with donors, and a franchising model. They have a detailed 'LEARNING MODEL' that utilizes digital, game-based learning technologies to address challenges in educational access, quality content, and teacher shortages. This model involves implementing programs with 'facilitators' at a 1-to-25 facilitator-to-student ratio, using commercially available tablets and award-winning game-based applications. TTWF also employs a 'MicroSchool model' which is an innovative solution to bring learning opportunities to underserved communities, equipped with tablets featuring gamified e-learning applications. They conduct independent research studies and use assessment tools, such as those validated by the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP), to measure the impact of their model on student learning, showing significant improvements in literacy and numeracy. Their ELAN solution is designed for scalability and adaptability, aiming to generate comprehensive insights into learning progress and application effectiveness to facilitate targeted improvements in content and teaching strategies, and to measure impact accurately.",
