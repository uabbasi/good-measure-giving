Their mission is to provide inclusive opportunities and resources to individuals with disabilities and their caregivers in the Muslim community of Houston, with a vision for a community where individuals with disabilities are fully accepted and included, and have adequate access to resources and support. Their core values are Compassion, Acceptance, Responsibility, and Empathy. The charity implements this through programs such as the Sakina Internship Program, Volunteer Enrichment Program, Youth Inclusion Training, and Community Events, all designed to foster inclusivity and change community perceptions. An external article further describes their model as one that 'uses faith values to drive the work outside of the traditional congregational space' and 'offers an inclusive community that seeks to strengthen educational and social support for families,' integrating Islamic values to advance parent support and empowerment.",
