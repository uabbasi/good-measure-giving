These foundational principles guide their work to create transformative change for their communities through high-impact litigation, policy engagement, public advocacy, narrative-shifting communications, and training for the next generation of advocates. Their mission is to promote justice and equity and protect the diverse spectrum of Muslim communities from anti-Muslim discrimination using litigation, policy engagement, and communications strategies. Their approach involves leveraging litigation that prioritizes people and social movements, coalitional advocacy that amplifies the work of organizers, and legislative engagement that holds policymakers accountable. Through strategic communications, Muslim Advocates aims to shift oppressive narratives about Muslim identity. The organization's path is guided by ongoing strategic planning.",
