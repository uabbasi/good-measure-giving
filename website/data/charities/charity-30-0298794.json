In 2023, the organization reported <cite id=\"3\">total revenue of $992,892</cite>, reflecting a significant shift in its financial scale compared to previous years. Despite its relatively small current budget, Muslim Advocates maintains a <cite id=\"4\">zakat-eligible status</cite>, allowing donors to fulfill religious obligations while supporting civil rights advocacy. The organization's work includes high-impact litigation and the <cite id=\"5\">Muslim Charities Accreditation Program (MCAP)</cite>, which helps strengthen the nonprofit sector. However, financial data indicates a <cite id=\"6\">program expense ratio of 54.9%</cite>, which is notably lower than the <cite id=\"7\">peer program ratio median of 83.8%</cite> for domestic poverty and advocacy organizations. Additionally, the charity faces challenges in fundraising efficiency, spending <cite id=\"8\">$0.61 to raise every $1</cite> in donations. While the organization holds a <cite id=\"9\">strong board of 10 members</cite> and maintains <cite id=\"10\">7.8 months of working capital</cite>, its long-term sustainability is tied to reversing a <cite id=\"11\">3-year revenue CAGR of -62.5%</cite>.",
