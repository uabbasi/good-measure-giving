The 'Path to a Cure' report is structured into four pillars, each providing progress indicators, key messages, opportunities, challenges, and the voice of survivors. Additionally, the Colorectal Cancer Care Initiative (CRCCI) and its associated report establish clear, actionable goals for colorectal cancer screening and care, serving as a tool for healthcare systems to measure progress, allocate resources, and improve outcomes. The CRCCI outlines two key goals with specific targets for timely screening, accurate diagnosis, and timely treatment initiation.",
