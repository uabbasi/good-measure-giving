This document details how MSF OCA aims to deliver specific forms of healthcare to vulnerable populations in crisis, emphasizing dignified, safe, and effective care through a person-centered approach and an overarching clinical governance framework. It also includes sections on 'Our Intervention Logic and Portfolio Composition'.
