This document outlines how the intervention's efforts are expected to result in desired impacts or results, including program theory, result mapping, effect route, and investment logic. It also adopts 'Action Model/Change Model Schema' for ToC development. Furthermore, MSF publishes various 'Strategic Plan' documents (e.g., MSF Canada Strategic Plan 2020-23, MSF OCA Strategic Plan 2020-2023, MSF Germany Strategic Plan 2021-2024) that detail their mission, principles, values, and strategic orientations to achieve their social mission and impact globally. These strategic plans describe their approach to delivering emergency medical assistance and fostering change. MSF also emphasizes impact and accountability, conducting systematic and objective evaluations to assess the quality and effectiveness of their interventions.",
