A secondary purpose is to help support Islamic Relief USA's administrative expenses, aiming to reduce the portion of donor dollars allocated to operating costs and maximize the amount directed to communities served. This approach links the Waqf's financial management activities directly to the long-term sustainability and programmatic impact of Islamic Relief USA.",
