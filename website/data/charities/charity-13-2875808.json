  "theoryOfChange": "Human Rights Watch (HRW) outlines its approach to bringing about change through a three-pronged methodology: Investigate, Expose, and Change. Their researchers investigate human rights abuses by speaking with victims and witnesses, corroborating stories with various sources, and often working with partner activists. They then expose this information widely through reports, videos, and social media to shape public debate and bring attention to their findings. Finally, HRW works to bring about change by presenting their findings and specific policy recommendations to officials, often in coalition with local groups, to achieve justice, prevent future abuses, and protect human rights. While not explicitly titled a 'Theory of Change,' this documented process functions as a strategic framework for how their activities lead to impact. HRW also engages in strategic planning, particularly in relation to international bodies like the International Criminal Court, and utilizes established human rights frameworks to assess situations and advocate for change.",

Financially, the organization is substantial, reporting <cite id=\"5\">total revenue of $94,185,941</cite> in the 2023 tax year. While HRW maintains <cite id=\"4\">a high overall score of 91.91.5/100 from Charity Navigator</cite>, its operational model differs from direct-service charities. Instead of providing immediate relief, it focuses on <cite id=\"1\">investigating abuses and pressuring governments</cite> to adopt policy changes. This advocacy-heavy approach results in a <cite id=\"5\">program expense ratio of 69.5%</cite>, which is lower than the <cite id=\"4\">peer program ratio median of 89.8%</cite> for international humanitarian organizations. However, the organization demonstrates exceptional fiscal resilience, maintaining <cite id=\"4\">25.4 months of working capital</cite> to ensure long-term stability for its multi-year investigative projects.",
