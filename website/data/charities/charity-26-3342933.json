The organization states its belief in 'human potential' and aims to help clients 'acquire the tools needed to unlock human potential and forge a healthy future' through 'thoughtful, well-designed programs'. Their approach is centered on three core components: Education, Life Skills, and Reentry. The curriculum is specifically designed for 'character reformation' and focuses on the emotional, mental, spiritual, and social development of incarcerated individuals to enable their reintegration into society. Furthermore, Tayba Foundation employs 'evidence-based parole plans' and provides 'coaching and peer-mentoring' as part of its reentry support. The organization also publishes 'Our Goals for 2021,' which details specific objectives for their programs, indicating a structured approach to achieving their mission. A third-party source also highlights Tayba Foundation's belief in 'the power of human change through holistic education, guidance, and support' and notes that their work helps prisoners become less violent, aids in their transition to the outside world, and lowers recidivism rates.",
