Their work is structured around three interconnected program areas: Education, Life Skills, and Re-entry. The educational philosophy focuses on \"character reformation through spiritual and behavioral modification,\" with a twofold purpose of nurturing self-awareness and encouraging self-discovery and transformation through healthy choices. Life Skills programs aim to equip clients with relational, financial, and problem-solving skills for successful reintegration. Re-entry services include mentoring, continuing education, resume support, networking, and job training. The foundation also mentions using \"evidence-based parole plans\" and \"effective assessment methods\" to reflect understanding of course material. Their \"Our Goals for 2021\" document further outlines specific objectives within these program areas, demonstrating a planned approach to achieving their mission.",
