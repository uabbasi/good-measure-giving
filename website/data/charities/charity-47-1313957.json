This framework integrates professional psychology into an Islamic framework, drawing from a 1400-year-old tradition. Their approach emphasizes psychological reconstruction, behavioral reformation, and spiritual elevation. The TIIP model considers the complex construct of a human being, focusing on 'aql (cognition), nafs (behavioral inclinations), r\u016b\u1e25 (spirit), and i\u1e25s\u0101s (emotions). It integrates classical spiritual practices like Mur\u0101qabah (Islamic Contemplation), Du\u02bf\u0101 (Supplications), and Dhikr into clinical practice. The 2023 Annual Report states that the TIIP model has been proven and is officially recognized as an evidence-based modality for the Muslim population.",
