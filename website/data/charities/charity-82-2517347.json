This page details how they deliver lifesaving care, strengthen local capacity, train health providers, and support related sectors like nutrition, WASH, and protection to build resilient health systems. Further evidence of a strategic framework is found in job descriptions for roles like Regional Programs Manager, which explicitly state the need to ensure rigorous alignment of country programs with MedGlobal's Medical Strategy and 3-year strategic vision. These roles also involve transforming strategic objectives into actionable and measurable operational plans and rigorously implementing Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning (MEAL) frameworks across all regional projects to track performance against key indicators and ensure continuous improvement.",
