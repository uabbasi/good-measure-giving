This framework defines anti-Palestinian racism as a form of racism that 'silences, excludes, erases, stereotypes, defames or dehumanizes Palestinians or their narratives.' It details various manifestations of this racism, such as denying the Nakba, justifying violence against Palestinians, failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people, erasing their human rights, excluding Palestinian perspectives, and defaming Palestinians and their allies. IUAPR's mission involves empirically researching, educating, and advocating on the impact of anti-Palestinian racism, directly applying this framework to understand and address the issue. Their website, antipalestinianracism.org, features a 'Learn more about Anti-Palestinian Racism' page that serves as a resource explaining this framework and its manifestations. IUAPR also publishes reports based on this understanding and provides recommendations for countering anti-Palestinian racism in various sectors, including K-12 schools.",
