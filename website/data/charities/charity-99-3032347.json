It is used as a working description and framework for institutions, organizations, companies, and individuals to address incidents of anti-Palestinian racism. The framework details various forms of anti-Palestinian racism, including denying the Nakba, justifying violence against Palestinians, failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people, erasing their human rights, excluding Palestinian perspectives, and defaming Palestinians and their allies.",
