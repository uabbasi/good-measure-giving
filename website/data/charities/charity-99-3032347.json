This report serves as a framework that provides a description of anti-Palestinian racism, explains how it operates to silence discourse on Palestine, and outlines its impacts on individuals and the broader community. It is used as a working description and framework for institutions, organizations, companies, and individuals to address incidents of anti-Palestinian racism. The framework details various forms of anti-Palestinian racism, including denying the Nakba, justifying violence against Palestinians, failing to acknowledge Palestinians as an Indigenous people, erasing their human rights, excluding Palestinian perspectives, and defaming Palestinians and their allies.",
