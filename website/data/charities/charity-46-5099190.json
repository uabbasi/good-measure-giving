This plan outlines high-level objectives and action steps. Their vision is to educate people about Islam as presented by Prophet Muhammad, aiming to separate history and culture from religion and teach it as a field of knowledge based on reason and logic, valuing critical thinking. The strategic objectives include providing research and an educational environment for the evolution of religious thought, translating existing research, supporting further research projects, educating children and adults through online and on-premises courses, creating audio/visual content, disseminating content via social media, reaching out to local communities, and providing forums for students to critically evaluate opinions and ask questions. Their methodology emphasizes exploring, understanding, discussing, and practicing Islam based on reason, rationality, and objective thinking, valuing research over blind belief, and evidence over opinion. For instance, their Sunday School program is designed to instill positive character traits and cultivate critical thinking in students through a comprehensive curriculum divided into stages.",
