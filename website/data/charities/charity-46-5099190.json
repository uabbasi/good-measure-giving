The objectives include providing a research and educational environment for the evolution and revisiting of Islamic religious thought, and establishing an educational institute where Islam is taught as knowledge based on reason and logic, rather than as a creed. The action steps detail how these objectives will be achieved, such as translating and supporting research, educating through online and on-premises courses, creating and disseminating audio/visual content, reaching out to local communities, and providing forums for critical questioning. Furthermore, GCIL's methodology emphasizes teaching students to prioritize research over blind belief, reason over tradition, evidence over opinion, rationale over dogmatism, and discovery over imitation.",
