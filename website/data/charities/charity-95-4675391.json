Operating at the intersection of government, media, and community engagement, the organization focuses on systemic change rather than direct service delivery. In the 2023 fiscal year, MPAC reported <cite id=\"2\">total revenue of $4,220,097</cite>, representing a significant <cite id=\"3\">three-year revenue CAGR of 30.5%</cite>. A key differentiator for the organization is its <cite id=\"4\">Hollywood Bureau</cite>, which works directly with the entertainment industry to ensure authentic Muslim narratives in film and television. Beyond media, MPAC engages in rigorous policy analysis, such as its <cite id=\"5\">assessment of 20 university profiles</cite> regarding academic freedom. While the organization maintains <cite id=\"6\">100% independent board members</cite>, its financial structure shows a <cite id=\"7\">program expense ratio of 57.2%</cite>, which is lower than many direct-service humanitarian peers but typical for advocacy-heavy models.
