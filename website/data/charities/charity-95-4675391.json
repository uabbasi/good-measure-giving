In 2023, the organization reported <cite id=\"3\">total revenue of $4,220,097</cite>, representing a significant <cite id=\"4\">3-year revenue CAGR of 30.5%</cite>. MPAC's work is uniquely positioned across several high-impact bureaus, including a <cite id=\"5\">Hollywood Bureau</cite> that consults on Muslim representation in entertainment and a <cite id=\"6\">Government Engagement</cite> arm that interfaces with federal agencies. The foundation also produces research-heavy outputs, such as its <cite id=\"7\">Academic Freedom Report</cite>, which involved <cite id=\"8\">assessing 20 university profiles</cite> to protect student and faculty rights. While the organization maintains <cite id=\"9\">strong liquidity with 21.4 months of working capital</cite>, its <cite id=\"10\">program expense ratio of 57.2%</cite> remains below the <cite id=\"11\">peer program ratio median of 81.5%</cite> for advocacy groups. Despite these financial efficiency gaps, MPAC remains a critical infrastructure piece for American Muslim civil rights, utilizing <cite id=\"12\">100% independent board members</cite> to oversee its strategic direction and policy advocacy.",
