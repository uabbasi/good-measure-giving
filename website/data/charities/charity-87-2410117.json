Their 'Fundraising Partnership Framework' outlines a strategy for sustainable fundraising for project outcomes and impact, encompassing planning, implementation, and evaluation. Charity Navigator's assessment of Human Appeal USA highlights their use of 'crucial evaluation tools in program objective-setting and activities,' as well as 'Strategic Planning Revisions' and 'Evaluation and Learning Programs'. The organization publishes annual impact reports, such as 'YOUR IMPACT IN 2024' and 'YOUR IMPACT IN 2023,' which detail the number of people helped and the types of projects undertaken, demonstrating a clear focus on measuring and reporting results. Furthermore, their 2021 Annual Report mentions the development of a 'governance framework' and the use of a 'Strategic Risk Register,' indicating a broader strategic planning effort. While an explicit 'Theory of Change' document is not directly published, these elements collectively describe an impact-oriented strategic framework.",
