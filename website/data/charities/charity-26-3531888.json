Beyond its domestic operations, the charity facilitates international relief efforts, including a <cite id=\"3\">Gaza Emergency Response</cite>, water pump installations, and orphan support across countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Somalia. Financially, the organization has seen significant growth, reporting <cite id=\"4\">$6,039,144 in total revenue</cite> for the 2023 tax year, representing a <cite id=\"5\">three-year revenue CAGR of 17.9%</cite>. While the organization demonstrates <cite id=\"6\">exceptional fundraising efficiency</cite> by spending $0.00 to raise every $1, its reported <cite id=\"7\">program expense ratio of 5.0%</cite> is critically low compared to the <cite id=\"8\">peer program ratio median of 80.0%</cite>. This discrepancy suggests that the organization's financial reporting may be incomplete or that a significant portion of its <cite id=\"9\">$5,726,976 in total assets</cite> is being held in reserve rather than deployed for immediate programmatic use. Despite these reporting gaps, the organization maintains <cite id=\"10\">100% independent board members</cite>, ensuring a high level of governance oversight for its direct service delivery model.",
