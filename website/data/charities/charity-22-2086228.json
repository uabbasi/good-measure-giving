This process involved a comprehensive discovery and assessment phase, including reviewing governance documents, finances, organizational structure, and conducting surveys, interviews, and focus groups with community members. The strategic planning culminated in a diagnosis report and a strategic planning retreat where key priorities were identified.

A defining characteristic of ISCJ is its massive financial safety net; it maintains <cite id=\"5\">101.2 months of working capital</cite>, an endowment-level reserve that ensures long-term stability but also contributes to a lower immediate program spending ratio. The organization is deeply integrated into the local social safety net, operating a <cite id=\"6\">food pantry and a dedicated Zakat-ul-Mal collection and distribution program</cite> that serves eight distinct categories of needy recipients. While the organization demonstrates <cite id=\"7\">high fundraising efficiency at $0.00 spent per dollar raised</cite>, its programmatic spending is relatively low compared to peers, with a <cite id=\"8\">program expense ratio of 32.2%</cite>. Despite this, ISCJ remains a cornerstone of regional Islamic life, distinguished by its <cite id=\"9\">history of female leadership</cite>, including the election of a female chairperson and the inclusion of <cite id=\"10\">23 women in leadership roles</cite> across its various committees.",
