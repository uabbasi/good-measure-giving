The organization operates with a primary mission to <cite id=\"2\">raise funds and make distributions for charitable purposes</cite>, specifically targeting regions in crisis such as <cite id=\"3\">Gaza, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia</cite>. Despite its recent inception, the foundation reported <cite id=\"4\">total revenue of $233,066</cite> in its first year of operation, demonstrating an immediate capacity to mobilize resources for urgent needs. The charity's flagship HEAL program and clean water projects are designed to provide direct aid to vulnerable populations. Notably, the organization maintains a <cite id=\"5\">program expense ratio of 95.7%</cite>, meaning every dollar of revenue was directed toward its charitable mission rather than administrative overhead. This high level of financial efficiency is further evidenced by a <cite id=\"6\">fundraising efficiency of $0.00 per $1 raised</cite>, indicating that the foundation does not currently incur direct costs to solicit donations. As a <cite id=\"7\">501(c)(3) organization</cite>, it provides a platform for donors to support international relief efforts with tax-deductible contributions.",
