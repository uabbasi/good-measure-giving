      "summary": "Imran Khan Cancer Appeal, Inc. (IKCA) serves as a vital financial lifeline for oncological care in Pakistan, primarily supporting the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre. Founded in <cite id=\"1\">1994</cite>, the organization has established a robust infrastructure for mobilizing international support to provide <cite id=\"2\">life-saving cancer treatment to underserved populations</cite>. In the 2023 fiscal year, the charity reported a <cite id=\"3\">total revenue of $17,974,012</cite>, representing a significant <cite id=\"4\">3-year revenue CAGR of 26.2%</cite>. This growth underscores a strengthening donor base committed to addressing the global health crisis of cancer in developing regions. The organization operates with remarkable financial leaneness, maintaining a <cite id=\"5\">program expense ratio of 97.4%</cite> according to recent filings, which ensures that donor contributions are directed almost entirely toward clinical and diagnostic services. This efficiency is further evidenced by a <cite id=\"6\">fundraising efficiency of $0.02 per $1 raised</cite>, a figure that significantly outperforms industry benchmarks. Beyond financial metrics, IKCA demonstrates high accountability, earning an <cite id=\"7\">overall score of 95.0/100 from Charity Navigator</cite>. The organization's impact is quantified through its support of specialized facilities that managed <cite id=\"8\">6,894 malignant cases</cite> and <cite id=\"9\">718 pediatric cancer cases</cite> in a single reporting cycle. By combining high-tech medical intervention with a faith-aligned financial model, IKCA bridges the gap between advanced oncology and those who would otherwise lack access to care.",
