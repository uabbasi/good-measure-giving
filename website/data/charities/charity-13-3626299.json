(IKCA) is a specialized humanitarian organization dedicated to providing life-saving oncological care to underserved populations, primarily in Pakistan.

The charity operates with exceptional fiscal leaness, reporting <cite id=\"2\">$17,974,012 in total revenue</cite> for the 2023 fiscal year while maintaining a <cite id=\"3\">program expense ratio of 97.4%</cite>. This indicates that every dollar of public support is effectively channeled into clinical and diagnostic services. IKCA's financial health is further validated by a <cite id=\"4\">95/100 overall score from Charity Navigator</cite>, reflecting strong accountability and leadership. Beyond its financial efficiency, the organization is a vital resource for Muslim donors, offering a <cite id=\"5\">verified Zakat-eligible giving model</cite> that supports the poor (fuqara) and needy (masakin) suffering from cancer. By focusing on a high-urgency cause area like global health, IKCA addresses a significant gap in medical infrastructure in the developing world, where cancer treatment is often prohibitively expensive for the majority of the population.",
