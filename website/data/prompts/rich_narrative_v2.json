This narrative\nelaborates on the baseline evaluation with detailed analysis and source attribution.\n\n## CRITICAL: Immutable Fields\n\nThe following fields are INHERITED from the baseline evaluation and MUST NOT be\nregenerated or modified. They will be injected after your generation:\n\n- headline (use exactly as provided)\n- at_a_glance (use exactly as provided)\n- amal_scores (use exactly as provided)\n- zakat_guidance (use exactly as provided)\n\nDO NOT include these fields in your output. Focus only on the enhanced narrative sections.\n\n## Citation Requirements - Wikipedia Style\n\nUse INLINE LINKED TEXT, not trailing citation markers. Wrap the specific claim text\nin a cite tag with the citation ID:\n\n- Format: `<cite id=\"1\">linked claim text</cite>`\n- The linked text should be the SPECIFIC CLAIM being cited (2-8 words typically)\n- Minimum: 10 citations per narrative\n- Target: 15-20 citations\n\n### Correct (Wikipedia-style):\n\"Islamic Relief USA has maintained <cite id=\"1\">a four-star rating from Charity Navigator</cite>\nfor over <cite id=\"2\">15 consecutive years</cite>, reflecting strong financial health.\nThe organization reported <cite id=\"3\">$165 million in revenue in 2023</cite> with\n<cite id=\"4\">83% directed to program expenses</cite>.\"\n\n### WRONG (academic-style - DO NOT USE):\n\"Islamic Relief USA has maintained a four-star rating from Charity Navigator [1]...\"\n\n### Deep Linking Requirements\n\nCitation URLs MUST be as specific as possible - link to the exact location where\nthe evidence can be found:\n\nGOOD deep links:\n- `https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/954453134#accountability` (specific section)\n- `https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/954453134` (org page)\n- `https://irusa.org/zakat/#eligibility` (specific page section)\n\nBAD shallow links:\n- `https://www.charitynavigator.org/` (homepage only)\n- `https://irusa.org` (no specific page)\n\nNEVER use these URLs (broken/deprecated):\n- Any guidestar.org URLs (site has been deprecated, URLs don't work)\n- Any candid.org profile URLs (require internal IDs we don't have)\n\nFor Candid/GuideStar data (e.g., Gold Seal of Transparency):\n- You can MENTION Candid seals in the narrative text\n- Do NOT wrap Candid mentions in <cite> tags (no working URL available)\n- Example: \"The charity holds a Gold Seal of Transparency from Candid\" (no citation)\n\nFor Charity Navigator data:\n- ALWAYS cite CN ratings with the CN URL: https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/{EIN}\n- Example: <cite id=\"X\">4-star rating from Charity Navigator</cite>\n\nWhen constructing source_url in citations:\n1. Use the FULL URL path to the specific page\n2. Add anchor fragments (#section) when citing a specific part of a page\n3. Include query parameters if they help locate the data\n4. For Form 990s, link to the specific tax year filing, not the org overview\n\n### Matching Claims to Deep Links\n\nChoose the most specific source URL for each claim type:\n\n| Claim Type | Best Source URL Pattern |\n|------------|------------------------|\n| Revenue, expenses, assets, financial data | Form 990 PDF or ProPublica filing |\n| CEO/executive compensation | Form 990 PDF (most authoritative) |\n| Ratings, accountability scores | Charity Navigator /ein/... |\n| Transparency, organizational profile | Charity Navigator or Website /about |\n| Program statistics, beneficiaries, outcomes | Annual Report PDF or Website /our-impact |\n| Mission, history, founding year | Website /about or /about-us |\n| Zakat eligibility, zakat policy | Website /zakat |\n| School counts, student numbers, impact metrics | Impact Report PDF or Website /our-impact |\n| Audited financial details | Audited Financials PDF |\n\n### Source Priority (highest to lowest confidence)\n1. **PDFs** (Form 990 PDF, Annual Report PDF, Audited Financials) - most authoritative\n2. **Form 990 filing page** on ProPublica - official IRS data\n3. **Rating agency pages** (Charity Navigator, Candid) - third-party verified\n4. **Specific website pages** (/programs, /our-impact, /about-us) - charity's own claims\n\nNEVER use the homepage (e.g., https://dil.org) for specific claims - always use the\nspecific page where that data can be found (e.g., https://dil.org/our-impact for\n\"214 schools\" claim).\n\n## Output Structure\n\nGenerate a JSON object with ONLY these fields:\n\n```json\n{\n

inline citations: `<cite id=\"X\">specific claim</cite>` for all facts\n- Every number, rating, or factual claim must be wrapped in a cite tag\n- The linked text should be concise (2-8 words) - the specific claim being cited\n\n### Cite Tag Usage Examples\nCORRECT:\n- \"The organization has <cite id=\"1\">$165 million in annual revenue</cite>.\"\n- \"They maintain <cite id=\"2\">a perfect 100 accountability score</cite>.\"\n- \"Programs reach <cite id=\"3\">over 40 countries</cite> worldwide.\"\n\nWRONG (don't cite entire sentences):\n- \"<cite id=\"1\">The organization has $165 million in annual revenue and serves millions.</cite>\"\n\n### Strengths (minimum 3)\n- Each strength needs citation support with cite tags\n- Be specific, not generic (\"Strong 4-star rating\" not just \"Well-rated\")\n- Include quantitative evidence where available\n\n### Dimension Explanations\n- Three narrative dimensions: credibility, impact, alignment\n- **impact** (scored, /50): How efficiently and effectively the charity delivers programs.\n  Use the component scores (Cost Per Beneficiary, Directness, Financial Health, etc.)\n  and their improvement suggestions to ground your explanation.\n- **alignment** (scored, /50): How well the charity fits Muslim donor priorities.\n  Use component scores (Muslim Donor Fit, Cause Urgency, Underserved Space, etc.).\n- **credibility** (narrative-only, not scored): Why donors can trust this charity.\n  Draw from Data Confidence signals (verification tier, transparency, data quality),\n  governance data, and external evaluations. Not a scored dimension.\n- Explain WHY the baseline scores were assigned\n- Wrap specific evidence in cite tags\n- Don't recalculate or change scores - explain them\n- Each dimension needs explanation + inline citations\n- **improvement**: For each dimension, include a constructive 1-2 sentence\n  suggestion for what the charity can do to improve that dimension.\n  Use cite tags to reference specific data points. Leave empty string \"\" if\n  the dimension is already near-perfect (score >= 90% of max).\n  Use the component-level improvement suggestions provided in Score Details.\n\n### Case Against (Constructive Limitations)\n- Focus ONLY on verifiable concerns from authoritative data:\n  - Financial efficiency (if program expense ratio < 70%)\n  - Transparency gaps (missing audits, limited reporting)\n  - Scale limitations (geographic reach, capacity constraints)\n  - Data gaps (missing outcomes, limited evidence base)\n- DO NOT cite news articles, Wikipedia controversies, or political allegations\n- Many Muslim charities face politically-motivated attacks from hostile sources\n  - These are NOT valid concerns for donor guidance\n- If no verifiable concerns exist, the case_against can be minimal\n- Include mitigation where charity is addressing concerns\n\n### Citation Quality\n- ONLY cite authoritative, verifiable sources:\n  - form990: IRS Form 990 data (ProPublica)\n  - rating: Charity Navigator, BBB, Candid, GiveWell\n  - evaluation: GiveWell, academic studies, third-party evaluations\n  - website: Charity's own website and annual reports\n- DO NOT cite:\n  - News articles (too often biased against Muslim charities)\n  - Wikipedia (editable, often contains hostile content)\n  - Advocacy/watchdog sites (often politically motivated)\n\n### CRITICAL: Claim-Quote Accuracy\n\nEvery citation must have a CLAIM that is DIRECTLY SUPPORTED by the QUOTE:\n\n**Rule 1: No Subjective Qualifiers**\n- DO NOT add adjectives like \"rigorous\", \"exceptional\", \"perfect\" unless they appear in the source\n- BAD: claim=\"rigorous monitoring system\" when quote=\"We track net usage\"\n- GOOD: claim=\"monitoring system that tracks net usage\" matches quote=\"We track net usage\"\n\n**Rule 2: No Fabricated Sub-Scores**\n- ONLY cite scores that appear in the provided data\n- If you only have `overall_score: 94`, do NOT claim \"100/100 Impact score\" or any beacon sub-score\n- BAD: \"perfect 100/100 Impact & Measurement score\" when data only has overall_score=94\n- GOOD: \"overall score of 94/100 from Charity Navigator\"\n\n**Rule 3: Quote Must Support Claim**\n- The quote field must contain text that DIRECTLY supports the claim\n- If you cannot find a quote that supports the claim, DO NOT make that claim\n- BAD: claim=\"100% of donations go to programs\" with quote=\"We are committed to efficiency\"\n- GOOD: claim=\"100% of donations go to programs\" with quote=\"100% of public donations buy nets\"\n\n**Rule 4: Use Exact Numbers from Data**\n- For scores, ratios, and metrics, use the EXACT values from the provided data\n- DO NOT round, estimate, or \"improve\" numbers\n- If overall_score=94.0, say \"94/100\", not \"perfect score\" or \"nearly 100\"\n\n**Rule 5: Low/Zero/Missing Program Expense Ratio - Never Hallucinate**\n- If program_expense_ratio is null, missing, 0%, or very low (<10%), this indicates INCOMPLETE DATA\n- DO NOT invent or hallucinate any percentage (like 85%, 90%, etc.)\n- DO NOT describe this as \"efficient operations\" or \"lean\" when you have no data\n- DO NOT claim ANY specific program expense percentage when the data is null\n- Instead, note that \"expense breakdown data is unavailable\" or \"financial breakdown is incomplete\"\n- The effectiveness_score will be LOW (5 or less) in these cases - your narrative must be consistent\n- BAD: \"spending 85% of its budget on programs\" when program_expense_ratio is null\n- BAD: \"dedicates 90% to program expenses\" when program_expense_ratio is null\n- GOOD: \"Financial data for expense breakdown is limited\" when program ratio is null\n\n**Rule 6: Zakat Eligibility Must Match Source Data**\n- Only claim a charity is \"zakat-eligible\" if `charity_claims_zakat: true` in the baseline\n- If wallet_tag is \"SADAQAH-ELIGIBLE\", do NOT describe programs as \"zakat-eligible\"\n- Do NOT include \"Zakat-compliant\" in donor motivations unless source data confirms it\n\n## Investment Memo Sections (NEW in V3)\n\nThese sections help sophisticated donors make informed giving decisions.\n\n### Using New Data Sources\n\nThe Investment Memo Data now includes additional sources. Use them as follows:\n\n**BBB Wise Giving Alliance Standards** (if available):\n- Include in `organizational_capacity` section: standards met, audit status, governance policies\n- If charity fails standards, include in `case_against` with specific failed standards\n- Use BBB Review URL in citations when referencing BBB data\n- \"Meets all 20 BBB standards\" is a strong trust signal worth highlighting in strengths\n\n**Grantmaking Activity** (if charity makes grants):\n- If `is_grantmaker` is true, include grant activity in the summary narrative\n- For charities where >30% of expenses go to grants, this is a key differentiator\n- List top grant recipients in `similar_organizations` context when relevant\n- Foreign grants indicate international reach\n\n**Charity Navigator Ratings** (if available):\n- Use CN beacon scores (Impact, Accountability, Culture, Leadership) in dimension explanations\n- Include `overall_score` and `financial_score` in `financial_deep_dive`\n- `fundraising_efficiency` (<$0.25 per $1 raised is excellent) belongs in effectiveness discussion\n- `working_capital_ratio` (months of expenses in reserves) belongs in long_term_outlook\n- CN CEO compensation can be used in organizational_capacity\n\n**CRITICAL: CN Score Distinction**\n- `overall_score` = the aggregate CN rating (average of all beacons) - use this when citing \"CN rating\"\n- `cn_financial_score` = just the Accountability & Finance beacon score - NOT the overall rating\n- NEVER cite `cn_financial_score` as the \"overall\" or \"total\" CN rating\n- If `overall_score` is null/missing, do NOT claim the charity has a CN rating\n\n**Candid Outcome Metrics** (if available):\n- `metrics_count` and `max_years_tracked` indicate evidence quality\n- Include in `impact_evidence.outcome_tracking_years`\n- `evaluation_documents` count goes in `external_evaluations`\n- Charting Impact data shows strategic clarity - mention if present\n\n**Revenue Breakdown** (if available):\n- Include in financial_deep_dive narrative\n- Diversified revenue (not 100% donations) indicates sustainability\n- Program service revenue indicates earned income capability\n\n**Beneficiary Data** (if available):\n- Include beneficiaries_served in summary and impact_evidence\n- Cost metrics (e.g., \"$3.50 per meal\") go in effectiveness discussion\n\n### Donor Fit Matrix\n- Help donors quickly assess if this charity matches their priorities\n- Use the provided wallet_tag for zakat_status\n- List actual geographic coverage from website data\n- Explain evidence_rigor based on the evidence grade\n\n### Ideal Donor Profile (CRITICAL - NEW)\n\nThis is the MOST IMPORTANT section for differentiation. Generate a DONOR-CENTRIC\n\"best for\" profile. This is NOT about what the charity does - it's about what\nKIND of donor would be most aligned with this charity.\n\n**Key principle**: Describe the DONOR, not the charity.\n\nConsider:\n- **Donor motivations**: Why would someone CHOOSE this charity over alternatives?\n- **Giving style**: Long-term commitment vs one-time? Monthly vs annual?\n- **Risk tolerance**: Does this charity suit cautious donors or those comfortable with uncertainty?\n- **Values alignment**: Evidence-focused? Faith-driven? Community-oriented?\n- **Not ideal for**: Be HONEST about who might prefer different options\n\n**GOOD best_for_summary examples** (describes DONOR):\n- \"Best for donors who prioritize rigorous evidence of impact and want to save the most lives per dollar\"\n- \"Best for donors who value Islamic institutional development and want to invest in long-term community infrastructure\"\n- \"Best for donors who care about Palestinian humanitarian needs and want zakat-eligible direct aid\"\n- \"Best for donors who want to fulfill zakat through established, large-scale humanitarian operations\"\n\n**BAD best_for_summary examples** (describes CHARITY - DO NOT USE):\n- \"Best for international humanitarian relief\" \u274c (describes work, not donor)\n- \"Best for education in South Asia\" \u274c (describes programs, not donor persona)\n- \"Best for poverty alleviation\" \u274c (describes cause, not donor profile)\n\n**donor_motivations** should answer: \"I want to donate here because I...\"\n**giving_considerations** should be honest about: scale, evidence gaps, access challenges, etc.\n**not_ideal_for** should be constructive: \"Donors seeking X may prefer alternatives\"\n\n### Impact Evidence\n- Explain what the evidence grade means in plain language\n- theory_of_change: PUBLISHED (has explicit TOC), DOCUMENTED (implied in materials), IMPLICIT (unclear)\n- If no RCTs exist, say so honestly\n- Include educational note about why evidence matters\n\n### Financial Deep-Dive\n- Use actual Form 990 data for yearly_financials\n- Compare program_expense_ratio to peer_program_ratio_median\n- Calculate revenue_cagr_3yr from the 3-year trend\n- Show how this charity compares to peers, not just industry standards\n\n### Long-Term Outlook\n- room_for_funding: HIGH (can absorb more), MEDIUM (some capacity), LOW (near capacity), UNKNOWN\n- maturity_stage: Startup (<5 yrs), Growth (5-15 yrs), Established (15-30 yrs), Institution (30+ yrs)\n- Include strategic priorities if available from website\n\n### Organizational Capacity\n- Use Form 990 data for employees, compensation\n- Calculate ceo_compensation_pct_revenue = (ceo_compensation / total_revenue) * 100\n- Use Candid data for board size and governance policies\n\n### Similar Organizations\n- Use the provided similar_orgs from Investment Memo Data\n- Each similar org should have a clear differentiator\n\n### Data Confidence\n- Be honest about data gaps\n- confidence_score: 90+ (excellent), 70-89 (good), 50-69 (moderate), <50 (limited)\n\n## Consistency Rules\n\n- DO NOT contradict baseline scores or facts\n- DO NOT recalculate AMAL scores\n- If agent discoveries reveal conflicting information, present as nuance, not contradiction\n- Reference baseline wallet tag correctly (ZAKAT-ELIGIBLE or SADAQAH-ELIGIBLE)\n\n## Data Provided\n\n{charity_data}\n\n## Available Citation Sources\n\n{citation_sources}\n\n## Baseline Context\n\n{baseline_context}\n",
