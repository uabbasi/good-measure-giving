  "content": "# CATEGORY: CIVIL_RIGHTS_LEGAL\n# DESCRIPTION: Civil rights, legal advocacy, civil liberties\n\n## WORLD-CLASS BENCHMARKS\nCompare this charity against these best-in-class civil rights organizations:\n- ACLU: Supreme Court cases, precedent-setting litigation, nationwide impact\n- NAACP Legal Defense Fund: Brown v. Board of Education, decades of civil rights victories\n- Human Rights Watch: Global human rights documentation, policy influence\n- Amnesty International: Prisoner advocacy, global campaigns\n\n## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR CIVIL RIGHTS/LEGAL ORGS\n\n### Systemic Leverage (0-30)\n- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Supreme Court victories, international treaty influence, laws changed at federal level. Examples: ACLU's marriage equality work, NAACP LDF's desegregation cases. **This tier requires landmark legal victories with nationwide precedent.**\n- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Federal court wins, national legislation influenced, amicus briefs in major cases\n- 12-19 (STATE/REGIONAL): State-level legislation, circuit court victories, regional policy changes\n- 6-11 (LOCAL): Local advocacy, individual case representation, community organizing\n- 0-5 (REACTIVE): Responding to incidents without structural change\n\n### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?\n- 7-8: Only org doing this specific legal work (ACLU's national infrastructure)\n- 5-6: Few alternatives for this population/issue area\n- 3-4: Other orgs doing similar civil rights work (most advocacy orgs)\n- 1-2: Many organizations cover similar legal issues\n\n**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?\n- 5-6: Islamophobia defense, Muslim civil liberties, surveillance targeting\n- 3-4: Immigrant rights, religious freedom affecting Muslims among others\n- 1-2: General civil rights with limited Muslim-specific focus\n\n**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?\n- 5-6: Legal infrastructure building (training lawyers, policy research)\n- 3-4: Litigation with moderate funding\n- 1-2: Well-funded advocacy areas\n\n### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components\n\n**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability\n- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, established legal governance, independent board\n- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls\n- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps\n- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure\n- 0-3: Weak accountability\n\n**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)\n- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0\n- Geographic: National network=3, Multi-state=2, Single state=1, Local=0\n- Zakat: Legal aid for poor can qualify (0-2 typical for civil rights orgs)\n\n### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count their work?\n- 7-8: Case tracking dashboards, client demographics, outcomes by case type\n- 5-6: Annual case counts, media mentions tracked\n- 3-4: Basic case counts\n- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions\n- 0: No metrics\n\n**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Cases won \u2192 policy changed \u2192 harm reduced?\n- 9-10: Documented policy changes linked to litigation outcomes\n- 7-8: Case wins with measured beneficiary impact\n- 5-6: Win rates tracked, some outcome indicators\n- 3-4: Case counts only, no outcome measurement\n- 0-2: No outcome tracking\n\n**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?\n- 6-7: Court decisions as validation, independent program evaluations\n- 4-5: External reviews, legal community recognition\n- 2-3: Standard financial audit only\n- 0-1: Limited external review\n\n## CRITICAL CALIBRATION\n\n**CAIR and similar orgs typically score 12-19 on Systemic Leverage:**\n- State-level work, important advocacy, but not achieving ACLU-level federal precedents\n- To score 20+, must demonstrate federal court victories or national legislation influenced\n\n**Difference from ACLU/NAACP LDF:**\n- ACLU: Has won dozens of Supreme Court cases\n- NAACP LDF: Brown v. Board, Loving v. Virginia - paradigm-shifting precedents\n- Most Muslim civil rights orgs: Important local/state work, not yet at that tier\n\n**Same rubric applies regardless of whose rights the org claims to defend.**\n",
