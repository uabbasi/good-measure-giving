Requires: $50M+ budget, 100+ researchers, decades of foundational work. Examples: Pew's polling methodology is THE standard; Brookings shapes federal policy at the highest levels; RAND's analysis methods are adopted by governments worldwide.\n- 20-25 (NATIONAL): Research regularly cited in Congressional testimony, influencing national policy debates, recognized as authoritative in a specific domain. Budget $5-50M.\n- 12-19 (REGIONAL/NICHE): Research used by state/local policymakers or authoritative within a specific community. Budget $1-5M, cited by other organizations.\n- 6-11 (LOCAL): Research with limited policy uptake, primarily internal use\n- 0-5 (MINIMAL): Opinion pieces without research rigor\n\n### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?\n- 7-8: Creates foundational data others depend on (ISPU's Muslim polling, Pew's methodology)\n- 5-6: Authoritative in specific niche, few alternatives\n- 3-4: Some alternatives exist in the space\n- 1-2: Many organizations cover similar topics\n- 0: Easily replaced by existing research\n\n**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?\n- 5-6: Research on American Muslim community, Islamophobia, Muslim-majority countries\n- 3-4: Research affecting Muslims among other groups\n- 1-2: General policy research with limited Muslim relevance\n- 0: No Muslim-specific focus\n\n**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?\n- 5-6: Research infrastructure systematically ignored (longitudinal studies, data collection)\n- 3-4: Some funding but below need (policy analysis, academic work)\n- 1-2: Well-funded research areas\n- 0: Oversaturated with funding\n\n### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components\n\n**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability\n- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, peer-review processes, strong research governance\n- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls\n- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps\n- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure\n- 0-3: Weak accountability\n\n**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)\n- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0\n- Geographic: National research impact=2, Regional=1, Local=0 (Note: research orgs rarely score 3 since geographic reach differs from humanitarian)\n- Zakat: Most research not zakat-eligible (0-1 typical)\n\n### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count what they produce?\n- 7-8: Publication metrics, citation tracking, media mentions dashboard\n- 5-6: Annual reports with research outputs and citations\n- 3-4: Basic publication counts\n- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions\n- 0: No output metrics\n\n**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Do they measure policy/behavioral change?\n- 9-10: Documented policy changes attributable to research\n- 7-8: Research cited in legislation, court decisions, or policy debates\n- 5-6: Policy citations, media uptake as proxy for influence\n- 3-4: Academic citations only, limited policy impact\n- 0-2: No outcome measurement\n\n**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?\n- 6-7: Peer-reviewed publications, methodology adopted by others\n- 4-5: External methodology reviews, academic partnerships\n- 2-3: Standard financial audit only\n- 0-1: Limited or no external review\n\n## CRITICAL CALIBRATION\n\n**ISPU expected scores:**\n- Systemic Leverage: 15-19 (REGIONAL/NICHE) - Authoritative within Muslim American research niche, but $1.6M budget is 60x smaller than Pew. Not yet at NATIONAL tier.\n- Ummah Gap: 16-20 (FOUNDATIONAL) - Creates polling data that didn't exist before. This is genuine infrastructure work.\n- Expected total: 72-80\n\n**Scale matters for Systemic Leverage:**\n- Pew ($100M) vs ISPU ($1.6M) = 60x difference\n- You cannot score 26-30 with a $1.6M budget\n- Quality research at small scale = 12-19, not 20+\n\n**Heritage Foundation is a BENCHMARK (not disqualified):**\n- World-class at policy influence regardless of ideology\n- Methodology and effectiveness are the standards\n- Same rubric for all research orgs\n\n**Yaqeen Institute:**\n- Focus on Islamic theological research\n- Score based on research rigor and uptake\n- Different audience (Muslim community vs. policymakers)\n",
