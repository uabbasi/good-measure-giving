Only mention single-year revenue if available.\n\n## Pre-computed Scores (for context only - explain in plain English)\n- GMG Score: {amal_score}/100\n- Wallet Tag: {wallet_tag}\n- Impact: {impact_score}/50 (Directness: {impact_directness}, Cost per beneficiary: {impact_cpb})\n- Alignment: {alignment_score}/50 (Donor fit: {alignment_fit}, Cause urgency: {alignment_urgency})\n- Data Confidence: {data_confidence} ({data_confidence_badge})\n\n## SCORE/RATIONALE CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL)\nYour dimension_explanations MUST be consistent with the scores above:\n- If a score is LOW (0-15): Explain what's MISSING or CONCERNING (e.g., \"Limited data available\", \"No third-party verification\")\n- If a score is MEDIUM (16-33): Balanced explanation of strengths and gaps\n- If a score is HIGH (34+): Can highlight strengths\n\nDO NOT invent positive data to justify low scores:\n- If Impact is low, do NOT claim the organization \"demonstrates effectiveness\"\n- If Alignment is low, do NOT claim strong Muslim donor fit\n- Only mention ratings/scores that are explicitly provided in the source data above\n\n## Available Sources for Citations (EXACTLY {num_sources} sources)\n{sources_list}\n\n## Citation Rules (CRITICAL - follow exactly)\n1. You have EXACTLY {num_sources} sources available, numbered [1] through [{num_sources}]\n2. ONLY use citation numbers that exist in the list above - do NOT use [N] where N > {num_sources}\n3. For EVERY [N] citation you use in text, you MUST include a matching entry in all_citations\n4. Format: [N] where N is the source number (e.g., [1], [2])\n5. Example: \"The charity maintains strong financial accountability [1].\"\n\n## Output Format\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown code blocks):\n\n{\n  \"headline\": \"One compelling sentence about the charity\",\n  \"summary\": \"2-3 sentences with citations like [1] and [2]\",\n  \"strengths\": [\"strength 1\", \"strength 2\"],\n  \"areas_for_improvement\": [\"area 1\"],\n  \"amal_score_rationale\": \"1-2 sentences explaining the overall score\",\n  \"dimension_explanations\": {\n    \"impact\": \"Plain English with citations about program effectiveness, financial health, and evidence quality\",\n    \"alignment\": \"Plain English with citations about donor fit, cause urgency, and track record\"\n  },\n  \"all_citations\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"[1]\",\n      \"source_name\": \"Source name from list above\",\n      \"source_url\": \"URL from source list (or null if not available)\",\n      \"claim\": \"The specific claim this citation supports\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nGenerate the narrative JSON:",
