  "content": "# CATEGORY: ADVOCACY_CIVIC\n# DESCRIPTION: Civic engagement, political advocacy, lobbying\n\n## WORLD-CLASS BENCHMARKS\nCompare this charity against these best-in-class advocacy organizations:\n- League of Women Voters: Nonpartisan voter engagement, century of impact\n- AARP: Massive membership, legislative influence, effective advocacy\n- NRA: Regardless of views, undeniably effective at advocacy and mobilization\n\n## SCORING CALIBRATION FOR ADVOCACY/CIVIC ORGS\n\n### Systemic Leverage (0-30)\n- 26-30 (WORLD CLASS): Consistently shapes national legislation, mobilizes millions, changes electoral outcomes. Think: AARP blocking Social Security changes, NRA's legislative track record.\n- 20-25 (NATIONAL): National policy influence, significant voter mobilization, federal-level impact\n- 12-19 (STATE/REGIONAL): State-level advocacy wins, regional electoral impact\n- 6-11 (LOCAL): Local voter registration, community organizing\n- 0-5 (MINIMAL): Advocacy without measurable political outcomes\n\n### Ummah Gap (0-20) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Replaceability (0-8)** - If this org disappeared, how hard to replace?\n- 7-8: Built unique civic infrastructure (AARP's member network)\n- 5-6: Few alternatives for this community (Emgage for Muslim civic engagement)\n- 3-4: Other orgs doing similar advocacy\n- 1-2: Many advocacy organizations available\n\n**Ummah Relevance (0-6)** - Does this disproportionately affect Muslims?\n- 5-6: Muslim civic engagement, Islamophobia policy, immigration affecting Muslims\n- 3-4: Civic issues affecting Muslims among others\n- 1-2: General civic engagement with limited Muslim focus\n\n**Funding Gap (0-6)** - Is this underfunded by Muslim donors?\n- 5-6: Civic infrastructure building, political engagement (vs. relief)\n- 3-4: Moderate funding for advocacy\n- 1-2: Well-funded advocacy areas\n\n### Absorptive Capacity (0-25) - 2 Sub-Components\n\n**Governance (0-15)** - Board independence, audits, accountability\n- 13-15: CN Accountability 95+, lobbying compliance, strong governance\n- 10-12: CN Accountability 85-94, good controls\n- 7-9: CN Accountability 70-84, some gaps\n- 4-6: Limited governance infrastructure\n- 0-3: Weak accountability\n\n**Deployment Capacity (0-10)** - Revenue (0-4) + Geographic (0-3) + Zakat (0-3)\n- Revenue: $100M+=4, $25-100M=3, $5-25M=2, $1-5M=1, <$1M=0\n- Geographic: National network=3, Multi-state=2, Single state=1, Local=0\n- Zakat: Advocacy typically not zakat-eligible (0-1)\n\n### Evidence of Impact (0-25) - 3 Sub-Components\n\n**Output Tracking (0-8)** - Do they count their work?\n- 7-8: Voter registration dashboards, advocacy campaign tracking\n- 5-6: Annual reports with engagement metrics\n- 3-4: Basic event attendance counts\n- 1-2: Anecdotal descriptions\n- 0: No metrics\n\n**Outcome Measurement (0-10)** - Political outcomes measured?\n- 9-10: Elections influenced, legislation tracked to advocacy\n- 7-8: Voter turnout changes, policy wins documented\n- 5-6: Some outcome indicators (registration rates)\n- 3-4: Engagement only, no outcome measurement\n- 0-2: No outcome tracking\n\n**Third-Party Verification (0-7)** - Is there external validation?\n- 6-7: Independent campaign evaluations, academic studies\n- 4-5: External reviews\n- 2-3: Standard financial audit only\n- 0-1: Limited external review\n\n## CRITICAL CALIBRATION\n\n**Same rubric applies regardless of political perspective:**\n- Emgage (Muslim civic engagement) and ACT for America (different perspective) both measured on effectiveness, not ideology\n- Score based on: Does the advocacy work? Does it produce measurable outcomes?\n\n**Effectiveness is the standard:**\n- An effective advocacy org from any perspective scores higher than an ineffective one\n",
